{'review': "Do not ride with me again !! I went with my mom from Regensburg to Prague and back. The outward journey was good, no problems. Return: At Prague Central Station there are 2 Flixbus stops. One directly in front of the train station and one across the street (big street that can only be crossed by an underpass). We were an hour before departure at the train station to find out which bus stop the bus departs. At both stops is the drive to Regensburg turn, not very helpful and totally confusing for people who do not know. But since on the ticket 'in front of the station' we also decided for this stop, as there were two more people for our bus arrived we were pretty sure that we were right. Then a bus came across the street. One of us went there to see if we were possibly wrong, even before he reached the bus, this drove off already. Still we thought that's not our bus, because he drove rather than ours should. After 10 minutes I then called the Flixbus hotline and after 5 minutes on hold I was told that this was our bus. I said he can not drive when 4 people are missing and then even more than stated. The answer was 'the bus drivers do not even know how many passengers they have'. There was no other bus on this day to Regensburg or surroundings. For our ticket s we have only one coupon -2 â‚¬ cancellation fees. No money back !! We had to go by train and get picked up in mushrooms, as no train drove to DE. Of course that cost us much more money and time. At home we were 2 o'clock instead of 23 o'clock. Thanks to Flixbus for the brilliant night !!!", 'stars': '2'}

{'review': 'I drove on the 19.10 with Flixbus from Frankfurt to Bern. Line 122.! 0 minutes before departure I got a text message that another bus came, a white from another company asked. Nice and good. When I got in I noticed that the bus looked pretty dirty, in the gaps between the window and the seat was all dirty on the floor. Times quite off that on my curtain something brown / red stuck what I did not want to define in more detail. On the descent was no real announcement nor was it declared that you should buckle up or how to turn on the light on the toilet. Accordingly, the first 5 passengers went to the bathroom with their mobile phone lamp. I used to be used to taking regular breaks, especially for smokers. I must also criticize that, the driver never stopped and drove on immediately. What can be quite exhausting with a journey of 7 hours. Finally arrived in Freiburg, I took the short opportunity to go out to quickly smoke one. After a few moves, the doors closed and the driver drove off. I was just able to get in fast, but 3 others were still outside. 2 of the passengers on the bus rushed to stop the driver. After all then back on the bus and the bus moved a few meters, we stopped again. The driver had left the flaps open at the bottom of the bus where the suitcases were stowed. They had to be closed then. On the whole, a huge horror for me. At the departure in Freiburg then came an announcement with "Next stop Bern at 13:25 clock" which was completely wrong. We were not even over the border! And the next station was Basel. Finally, I arrived on time as on my ticket listed in Bern.', 'stars': '2'}

The booking process was straightforward, except for the fact that I was wrong in the date.

The trip from Berlin to Jena turned out to be simply horrible. The bus was completely overheated and the heater could not be turned off. The toilet stank pitifully, so that the travelers who sat in the immediate vicinity, the nose shut up when the toilet door opened. The bus driver was unfriendly to aggressive, but drove at least reliably.And on my return I saw then that I had been deducted the canceled account booking. At my request, I received the notification that I could get the money back, minus a handling fee of 2 euros. My question, why I would have to take over the 2 euros, since this is not my fault, remained unanswered until today and I was not refunded the amount either.

The busses inside neat, average good seating, not handicapped accessible. WLAN o. K., In the basement odor nuisance by toilet. Only cold drinks and a few sweet snacks are offered. The driver in Aachen came in the morning about 10 minutes later, but was very friendly and fix. Shortly before Munich, the toilet was cleaned (?!); a little later came the statement that all passengers have to change to another bus - this bus must be in regular maintenance after a one-week use. Hee? Maintenance is known to be "planned", what was wrong - the reason for the communication, the technical condition of the bus, poor planning of the maintenance or the lack of interest in customers? Overall, a delay of about 30 Minuten.Der bus for return (21:30) came in time, the driver was nice and competent. But his colleague ... He ran with unclear "goal" several times around the bus through the crowd of waiting passengers with the statement "I need space!", Without causing anything. Then both disappeared, the departure time was now clearly exceeded. Then they came back, and the "companion" began again to push through the waiting, shaking again and again at the one luggage door, which was obviously closed. Finally, with a force that the latch almost flew away ... I do not know if the door has survived the well. The driver came in, quietly pointing at the other, beside the existing and unfinished luggage door, and the opportunity to open the second locked door from the inside. Now the "companion" was shaking the inside of the said door with all his strength ... (you already suspect? Yes, with "zero success"). The driver tried all the keys, and one fit ... The passengers crowded from one bus entrance door to the other, because it was not clear how to proceed - check in first or drop off your suitcases. The "companion" now stepped out of the inside of the luggage compartment, shooing the people standing in front of him again with his "I need space here!" and the call "Amsterdam!" Many came forward, under it directly in front of him standing couple with a toddler and stroller. There was an immediate discussion about the number of luggage and passengers, he always counted with the accompanying family member. Nothing happened until the driver helped. As someone "Rotterdam?" asked, the "companion" dismissed this brusquely - "I said Amsterdam, understood!" The driver has just helped. The passengers were extremely angry, one has already threatened with beatings. Finally, everyone found a place in the bus, there were still a number of empty seats; whoever could, availed the free seat to sleep until we left Stuttgart stop, so around 01: 10h. The "companion" answered with "I need all seats immediately, for 15 people!" and shook anyone who has used a vacant space. Someone\'s shoes had slipped into the corridor, the "companion" was already yelling, "Whose shoes, whose shoes?" and shook people again with "Are they their shoes?". Now an elderly lady came who was torn from sleep and did not understand what was going on - she also explained that she was hearing-impaired and could not understand what her "companion" wanted from her. There was again incomprehensible discussion on the part of the "companion" because of hand luggage of the woman, he threatened her with police use and ejection from the bus, reported by mobile phone already a bus delay because of "claim of Mehrplatz o. by the woman and the planned deployment in the headquarters. That would mean a considerable delay for everyone. After extensive measurement of the hand luggage by the "companion" and "penalty payment" the journey continued with the woman and her luggage. After the following stop there were still some free seats ... Aachen we reached with 30 minutes delay and a fresh Crew.Fazit: The rides are cheap, previous drivers good. No value is placed on service, no value is placed on the crew. The burden on the crew is inappropriate, people are sorry for me. This then comes 1: 1 at the riders. Flixbus has no clientele but a Busauslastungsmenge, now this company uses the position of the provider market.

In general, he was EXTREMELY RUDE, something many times crossing the border of normal customer friendly communication. Also, he was announcing everything in Dutch, which is strange for an international bus route where most of the people were foreign tourists. I strongly think that these kind of people shouldn't work in the companies with a good reputation and customer-oriented, which I believe FLIXbus still is. I don't believe such people can change or undergo some training. It's character which don't change, so - my humble advice: just fire them and get normal people on job.

{'review': 'These bus drivers had no orientation when we arrived at the airport. Despite signs "Terminal 2 straight" the bus driver turned right into the outdoor area. He looked stunned at the hall of DHL, which was far away from Terminal 2. The angry passengers warned the bus driver that he should finally drive to Terminal 2. It was very close with the checkin. Instead, the bus driver got out and ran about 50 meters behind the cleaning staff. The cleaning staff did not know where Terminal 2 is. A passenger went into one of the buildings independently, where no employee was found. The passengers were now so annoyed and loud angry, because we had lost by a traffic jam just 1, 5 hours already. When changing the driver at a rest stop, the bus driver stared so stupidly in a queue waiting at the taps, although 2 rows were only 2 cars. After waiting for 15 minutes, the bus driver finally noticed that the other ranks allowed a continuation of the journey. After the bus driver still did not know how he should get from the DHL hall to Terminal 2, he drove on good luck in the next street. Now it was enough for all passengers. He was asked to open the doors. 5 passengers got into a taxi to reach the check-in. All other passengers were wandering in the open air to get to Terminal 2 somehow. I myself found by chance the 800 meter long way to Terminal 1, there to the shuttle bus to Terminal 2 to climb. These bus drivers have cost us a lot of nerves and damaged the reputation of Flixbus to some extent. How do you send such diletants to a destination they have never checked before?

{'review': "It's been more than a year for me to travel with flixbus, and I have to say that I find the service much worse. It is undoubtedly dependent on the country where you take it (traveling a lot around Europe), but in the past two months I happened to do 6 trains between Italy and Denmark, stopping here and there, at different times and good or bad the experience was always the same. Leaving the bathroom hygiene, that probably depends on who is at the moment at that time, and which however also depends on the fact that there are always a lot of people on the bus some of whom behave like barbarians, I must say that on some things you can fly over. 1) Punctuality. I understand very well that you are traveling by land, traffic etc, but it would be desirable that the driver WARNED during the delay, how late it is and if it increases, say to the microphone. The last 5 trips I had between 45 minutes to 3 and it passes late, without anyone warning us of anything. 2) Stops. It seems to me that the stops depend on the driver and the number of hours he drives. It is unthinkable to face an 11-hour journey, which with the delay become 14 and not to stop unless you bring people down. Good that it is late, it's good that drivers do not need it because they give the gear in half But there are also passengers, and so many make long distances (as in my case the famous 11/14 hours, but I was not alone). 3) The methods of communication. Maybe it's my limit, but I do not know all European languages. When the driver says something to the microphone, he could make a small summary in English. Repeat maybe my limit, but in Germany the communications were in German and only in German, in Italy only in Italian, in France only in French and I think of all the poor passengers who do not speak the language of the place from which they left the flixbus.4) The organization. Maybe it's a bit general as an affirmation, but the organization leaves it to be desired. Starting from: landing at the destination and having to climb yourself to retrieve luggage in the hold (do not ask where the drivers are, I do not know); you get to a destination but you do not know what it is because the driver does not declare it and with delay you do not know if your destination is yours or a stop before or after; during a trip I'm NOT LOOKING, to some one there seemed to be more passengers than there !! Or anyway more passengers than they should be. PANIC for good 20 minutes, stand in the middle of nowhere to figure out that it happened. Conclusion as tight as sardines we continued the journey until the stop after where someone went down. I think flixbus is a great idea and could offer a great service. at the beginning it certainly was so. But now take one, it means getting boarded hoping to go for the best and leave at least two or three hours in advance because the delay has become chronic. A real shame.", 'stars': '2'}

Drivers will make fun of you to the other bus riders and be really rude to you. A trip that should have cost me 100â‚¬ ended up costing 250â‚¬. Oh and they knew it was bad. Every other Flixbus I took I recieved a email asking me to give them feed back but not this time. That\'s the short summary here\'s the story. I took a bus from Ghent to Cologne on Saturday July 29th 2017 with another planned from Cologne to Hamburg 2.5 hours later. The bus was 3.5 hours late. Upon our late arrival the bus drivers called ahead to ensure I could get to Hamburg. The lady on the phone said it should be no problem and I would receive a text confirming my ride on the next bus. Not only did I not receive a text the woman refused to put me on another bus to Hamburg. She said I would be refunded and then I could buy another ticket however, the bus to Hamburg was full so I\'d have to wait until tomorrow. I had to cancel all my buses and trains and rebook everything costing me an extra 100â‚¬. Not to mention I was stranded in a foreign city and was forced to find accommodation at 3am! And when you called back the Flixbus operater did not pick up the phone. The next morning I bought a ticket to Kiel (Mind you I had to get to Stockholm somehow) it stopped at Dortmund. My second bus was 1 hour late from Dortmund to the next cities. The bus driver was not pleasent when he realized I spoke no German. At one of our stops he was making his usual announcements in German and the girl sitting next to me explained everyone was laughing because he said "unless your like this American who has no clue what is go in on because she doesn\'t understand me but pretends she does". I arrive at kiel almost 1.5 hours late. Causing me to almost miss my train. (Which I had to rebook for a substantial sum) My bus from Copenhagen to Stockholm ends up being being 2 hours. Mind you I\'m a student and by this time I had no choice but to sit by a 9 hour bus ride because my missed train to Stockholm was much to expensive to rebook.  All and all I took nearly 12 buses in 1 month And or than half of them were unpleasant or just late. Customer service center is terrible and it\'s just easier to pay more and take a train or fly.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'Unusually bad service and info about the trip. I was going by bus 20.07.2017 at 7.05 am from Copenhagen H to Malmo. 6.20 I received sms about delays up to 46 min. I waited nicely for 7.51, and the bus had not arrived. As the bus was delayed approx. In 1.5 hours I called the hotline and had to wait in la-a-ang time until they took the phone. The employee could not tell where the bus was to her, just on the way to Copenhagen, and why all information about it had disappeared on their website so we could not keep an eye on it. It might not be so important because they do not update their website regarding delays. There has always been +46 min. Finally, the bus finally reached a 2 hour delay. I would like to have been told right from the start so I might go for a walk in Copenhagen and not be so stressed.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'Flixbus is a cheap service. However it is always late. Even though when the bus could be in time the bus driver decides to stop anywhere for a 15 minutes break that causes an additional delay. While understanding that people need to have a break while driving - if you need a break than dont claim that the trip will take x hours. Add your break to the travel time..', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': "Travelled from Naples to Bari.Flixbus delayed our journey by 1h 40min absolutely unexpectedly. Didn't call, didn't apologise, simply sent an email half of day before.Also not very accurate in time, poor WiFi.Good electricity socket, quite comfortable.", 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'Great to have wifi and sufficient space ! However, the foul odor from the toilet was constant and made the trip somewhat quite unpleasant. Shame !', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': "1) Our bus, had plugs but these were not working. And it wasn't just ours, as we asked other people seating near us as well.2) No wifi on board even though our route was not mentioned as a route with no wi-fi3) Toilet's water was broken and we could not use the toilet. As a result the driver did JUST ONE extra stop before even exiting France and no other stop for using a toilet.It was a really bad journey, which dissapointed us very much, considering the great name and reviews we got from the internet and friends on their experience with Flixbus.", 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'This company needs to be upfront regarding  luggage cost!  Hidden pricing!! When making reservation there needs to be place to enter to pay additional for luggage more than 24"!!! If we hadn\'t had cash to pay extra $20 driver demanded for oversized luggage (standard travelling size) we would have not been able to go.  24" is only overnight luggage and most have larger than that so it needs to be stated clearly upfront with selection to pay total real cost upfront!!!  With the luggage charge, it makes no sense value wise to take flix bus as train much more comfortable with bathrooms and ability to walk around so trains way better deal!!! Our driver from Leipzig to Munich was rude, yelling at us to get off the bus when stopped for break.  Never again!!!', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': "I traveled from Dusseldorf,Germany to Frankfurt Airport Terminal 2 on 15 May 05:50 AM, Monday . My Booking is #8038314686 Connection X28 Direction Munich central bus station. Actually this is regarding a laptop backpack that I forgot inside bus cabin on that day of travel.I have called Flixbus customer care within the moment I left my bag inside the bus and bus left the station but flixbus customer care suggested me to complain online instead of giving me the bus route and location of the bus or contacting the bus Driver. Bus left the station infront of me when I remembered I forgot my bag inside the bus.I called Flixbus hotline number at the same time and informed them that I forgot my bag in the bus,  They assured me that I just need to raise lost and found form on flixbus.com and I will receive my bag. If they would have been pro-active that day they would have called the driver at the same time and informed him about my bag in the bus cabin. I would have received the bag by now. Unfortunately they didn't inform the bus driver and it resulted in overall frustration for me.Since I was having my flight back to India same day, so I have complained about it on flixbus website and by calling flixbus customer care on 15th May only. It has been more than two week now but I am yet to hear anything from customer care and still waiting for the bag. Customer care reply on facebook page is good but I am still unable to retriev my bag.Overall it was a bad journey that resulted in financial loss and mental frustration.", 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'Sometimes cheaper than the competition, but the service leaves much to be desired. I traveled 3 times with them and the drivers were all rude. One of them barked literally on the travelers ...', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'I would have given Flixbus a higher rating but when I bought the Interflix for 99 euros, I was told that the money had gone through, but then I was taken to a new page where it said that "an error with the order" and that the order was "cancelled and deleted"...yet they still debited my account. So here I sit, 99 euros poorer and no Interfix Pass. I have emailed Flixbus twice as I am desperate to get this resolved. I would really like to receive what I paid for. All my other Flixbus experiences have been great until now. I am afraid that this incident might overshadow the good previous experiences that I have had with Flixbus. I have used an old booking number in order to hopefully receive a reply and to get this problem resolved.Cayla', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'Took flixbus on 28 Feb 2017, 22:20 from Basel SBB to Cologne Germany.Too many sokers on bus, filled the bus with passive smoke and smoked whenever , wherever it stopped in front of bus doors and filled bus with smoke. Also, the passengers in groups from Milano forced to move out from seats despite vacant seats.  The bus also faced immigration issues on swiss border due to some passengers validity of documents onboard.', 'stars': '2'}

{'review': "I used their service a dozen of times by now, and at first really liked it. The buses have all the necessary stuff (sockets, wifi, wc), and drivers sometimes tend to be really chatty. I was more than satisfied by my previous trips and so me and two of friends used Flixbus during our recent trip in Italy. France and Belgium although there were cheaper options available. Bus trips in Italy and France went smoothly, no issues on that. But here i want to talk about the last trip that rather disgruntled me and left a sour taste in my mouth, We booked a bus trip from Antwerp to Amsterdam and it arrived more than two hours later than scheduled and in order toin order to get information on the bus we called Call Center several times, first time it was impossible to connect, second time we had to hold the line for quite a long a time and when the phone operator finally came we had just enough time to say our booking number and then the phone run out of balance. The bus driver offered no explanation on this delay and in actuality had an argument with another passenger who has very much upset on the delay. We then wrote down a message to their customer service but they only sent message(which i assume is Automatic) in German. Too bad, i actually liked the service quite a bit. I won't be prioritising it over other providers any longer.", 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'My girlfriend and I decided to go for a one-day trip to MalmÃ¶ from Copenhagen. We found some cheap tickets with Flixbus, but maybe it was a bit too cheap! No service, total of 1,5 hour delay without information, tried to call the hotline, but no answer so hang up after 15 min and when the bus arrived non of the employees spoke Danish, Swedish or English.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'I had travelled many times with flix bus, and i used to be satisfied traveller.But few days ago, on 06 may, we were not allowed to board the bus from dresden to prague. I was travelling with my family including my daughter who is 7 months old. We were asked to bring a baby seat, which i was unable to arrange,then we were asked to contact the customer service, which was always occuppied and difficult to reach through. The bus left without us. We had travelled through flix bus in the morning from prague to dresden,no one asked us for a baby seat! Indeed we travelled to cesky krumlov using flix bus, we were not asked to bring a baby seat. I had noted a family with a small kid, when i pointed out, that if others can travel without a baby seat, why cant we? The answers were vague. If the baby seats are mandatory, it should be provided by the carrier, not the passenger.Subsequently we travelled to prague by a student agency bus, no one there asked us to bring a baby seat. I have written a complaint to flix bus twice, but no response so far! Thanks flix bus for wasting my money, time and poor handling of the situation by your dresden staff.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'I am a musician, traveling around Europe.  I have had a great deal of experience traveling on buses, trains and planes with my gear, and most companies have been willing to work with me to make sure that my guitar, most importantly, is safe.  On quiet services with other carriers, with enough space, I have been allowed to put my guitar, which travels in a soft case, in the overhead compartments, where it fits easily and without difficulty.  On busier services I have been allowed to hold it in my lap.  On Flixbus however, I have found several drivers to be unreasonable and bullying in their approach to asking me to put my guitar in the luggage compartment.  There has been no flexibility or understanding from them; only a dogmatic insistence on the Flixbus rule that guitars must be stowed, combined with a completely unsatisfactory place for my guitar, in with all the other bags.  If Flixbus is going to insist that fragile luggage like this cannot go in the cabin, even when the bus is only half-full, they have to offer a safe alternative to the luggage hold, where a guitar like mine could easily be crushed.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': "I have used this bus company many times. It's convenient and the price is cheaper than train, and has many routes. All buses from the former MeinFernbus must be avoided as the Internet onboard is always poor (works 1 out of 10 times). Customer service is poor too (Yeah, you got cheap price, and also poor customer service). I would recommend to use it if you want to save money and not in a hurry time - good value for money.", 'stars': '2'}
