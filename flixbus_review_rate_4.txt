Reckless fellow travelers were exhausting - noisy conversations and phone calls in the middle of the night do not have to be real. For snoring you can not do anything, but for the neighbors it is of course really disturbing. Fortunately, I had Ohropax here.

But still a bit Whack.Da but I drove from Rijeka to Vienna, the ride was very long and I noticed a few unpleasant things. I hardly slept in the night before the ride and was not showering why I had a slightly unpleasant body odor. Once when I wanted to get off the bus, I fell down the stairs and unintentionally kicked a girl. My neighbor, a very nice girl who had sweetened my ride a bit, wanted to play with me "city, country, river", but I was really bad. Most of the time I had to drive, and although I\'m a pretty talkative person, I play "Silent Fir" and just be quiet as the other passengers wanted to enjoy a quiet ride. There was also the problem that although each seat a reading light was provided, but my fault was. Soon my phone had no battery and of course my charging cable gave up the ghost during the bus ride. The bus was about half an hour late because we stood on the A1 in a traffic jam. At the beginning of the ride I wanted to sleep, because I had the same as I said the night before little sleep. Unfortunately, we were on a fairly winding track at that time and every time I nodded I almost fell into the hall at every turn, as I regretfully did not get a window seat. Still, I could enjoy the wonderful view as my neighbor, who has been climbing my bag all the time, slept most of the time and gave me an excellent view out the window. Very pleasant was the fact that you could adjust the seats to a comfortable location. My travel companion Leo, however, enjoyed sitting alone and claiming two seats for himself. He curled up and fell asleep as sweet as a honeybee in a chocolate coat on the two seats. When he awoke he massaged my head, which I also liked very much. Since the ride was very long made our sympathetic bus driver in regular sections 15min break time. It was a very pleasant, a bit chaotic ride and I would go with FlixBus again and again, only I find train driving just geiler.Lg Felicitas', 'stars': '4'}

{'review': 'Our first trip with FlixBus, but not the last. Our journey in St. Gallen began with a delay of 20 minutes, which we were previously informed via email. The delay was overtaken by Munich. The whole ride was very pleasant and at any time we felt very safe thanks to the forward-looking drive of our driver. The passenger cabin and especially the toilet were extremely clean, which surprised us very positively. The seating comfort with the generous legroom and the side-shifting seats leaves nothing to be desired. Also the functioning WLAN was not missing which I did not use however much. We will certainly continue to use FlixBus on the basis of our experience.', 'stars': '4'}

I went with PolskiBus, although I booked with Flixbus, there was no information on the flixbus side, that you can reserve seats and in the bus no information which seats are occupied and which are still free and thus I should implement 4 times, which is very annoying.

Unfortunately, there are no fixed departure platforms at most bus stations, so you have to keep an eye on the entire bus station at departure time.

We have been several times with the bus, in the beginning everything was great, but we still consider, for the following reason, as already mentioned, the journey times to break are too long, 5 hours was also our experience, where is there the safety for guests and also for the driver?

Straight on medium distances (1-3 hours), Flixbus is a great alternative to Train. It quickly becomes a bit more uncomfortable because the freedom of movement in the bus is of course more limited than in the train. Comfortable clothing and getting off during breaks provide a remedy. The air is much more pleasant than on the train: it will come as no surprise that the ventilation in the Flixbus is better than that of regional trains. But even ICs have a much drier room climate and odors are quickly in the air - a minute ago, the lady behind me in the Flixbus used a deodorant, and you can barely smell it:) The background noise is quieter than in the train; There are no popping sliding doors with missing gasket.', 'stars': '4'}

The driver was unbelievably friendly, he was well understood even though he did not come from Germany, he always kept you up to date and constantly said that you can use the USB ports with him to charge his cell phone or tablet. Also his driving style was great, you felt really safe. He had to take a break of 45 minutes and refuel once, which is why we finally got an hour late with the arrival in Hamburg (we did not get stuck in traffic).

Since we in WÃ¼rzburg by a Dusseligkeit (toilet in the main train station) had missed the onward journey to FFM and 3 pieces of luggage remained on board I cried in my desperation the Flixbus hotline in Berlin. The lady was very brazen on the phone, showed no understanding without a solution. No she can not inform the driver. I should fill out the form "lost property" online (which I did). My question, if I could go to the Flix office in FFM, she said no. After all, we were able to continue the journey an hour later at our own expense. In FFM, a Flixbus employee gave us the deciding tip for the next day\'s departure of the bus to Munich! We did that. And behold, two of our bags were on board.

However, the two-hour delay in Berlin was not in order, because due to compliance with driving times (breaks must be strictly enforced ) the arrival was almost impossible. In case of cases the bus driver would have had to park the bus in front of Berlin! However, because of his experience, it has still worked. Since the route is very congested, this problem is well known, should not be waived here at the expense of the dissatisfaction of the travelers on a second driver. The price of 9.90 â¬ is very tight in my opinion and it should be "reasonable" prices. A flight for 25 â¬ to Mallorca is also not OK. The bus was okay so far, the driver was at least in the beginning in a bad mood (something I had seen the day before in a television report, there was a positive and negative gelaunter bus driver shown) , I hoped on my day of traveling on a good-humored driver ... The stops should be better marked with references to an existing toilet, as it is pointed out in the bus to use this only in an "emergency". Internet access was easy, However, the connection only satisfactory, due to the frequent dropouts. I would repeat the ride, as it is really stress-free, if you have no deadline.

Unfortunately, I already had a completely broken or heavily worn seat belt 3 times and from time to time you can not adjust the backrest (anymore). 10Min late departures are quite common, probably. 50%, but I do not think so bad. Lately, unfortunately, the significant delays of 30/45 minutes and more (more congestion due to summer holidays?), In more than half of the cases without notification by SMS or staff, which of course, especially at the high temperatures at present (07 + 08/15), and, at least at the stop Dresden Hbf, where there are no shadows or seating, is extremely annoying and sometimes seriously harmful to health. With a corresponding delay message you could at least go somewhere in the shade, but if you do not know when the bus leaves you unfortunately have to stay there. The riders are usually very friendly and all drive absolutely neat. In principle, I find that there is a snack and drink offer (in most buses), but that one must distract by the purchase of the / the driver * during the trip, I think rather not so good.

The only drawback are the twice as expensive prices, if you want to buy the tickets DIRECTLY on the bus. I can not understand, after all, these customers always take the risk, just to get NO card anymore. And then you pay twice as much for this risk? This is definitely not understandable and should really be changed in my opinion.", 'stars': '4'}

The comfort is on an acceptable level, more than 5 hours I would not want to spend the bus. You run the risk of landing in a traffic jam, so there are often delays, but no one can do anything. The drivers are indeed: tired and a bit listless. I do not think it's really scary now, the profit is more than modest, it saves money on every corner.

There was also enough leg space for my long legs.The second trip, however, was delayed, and the bus that arrived was clearly a replacement. Therefor, it lacked wifi, overhead space was a little smaller, but still just enough to fit my backpack, and leg-space was only just acceptable for my legs.Overall, assuming you will have the actual flixbus to drive you, I can highly recommend it. How often a replacement bus is used by them, I obviously don't know.", 'stars': '4'}

{'review': 'I booked a trip from Brussels to Mainz. There was no direct bus, so I had to change on Leverkusen Mitte. I spontaneously decided to do this trip, so I had booked just 3 days before my departure. Usually, I use train, but in that situation I wanted to try a bus to discover one more city on my way to Mainz. Of course, after I realized that Leverkusen is not the best choice. The trip was very well priced, I paid around 40 EUR, relatively around 10 per each bus I used. Starting from Brussels to Leverkusen Mitte(the first bus), everything was fine. I did not try the wi-fi on the first bus. However, I did not like the second part of the trip from Leverkusen Mitte to Mainz, because of delay. This is not something to blame the company for. They send me two messages that the bus will be late 50 minutes and 75 minutes. The bus arrived with 105 minutes delay. The wi-fi on this one was extremely slow, even though most of the people were sleeping. I was 2 seats away from the toilet, it was smelling unfortunately. The driver was the worst experience on this trip. I am not aware how many breaks usually a driver should do, but this one did once 20 minutes and once 5 minutes for 200km. He even got confused in Wiesbaden and went into wrong direction which caused even bigger delay. On my way back everything was good. The drivers were very nice, especially from Leverkusen to Brussels. The wi-fi was working good. There was even a coffee machine in the bus, I think the coffee was for free, but I am not sure. Overall I would grade that company with 7 out of 10. The advantages are free wi-fi, good price/quality, relatively new buses, not so many ppl, in 3 out of 4 journeys I was sitting alone, plenty of space between the seats.Disadvantages - the driver in the second bus, some maintenance issues like some lamps were missing and when the air-conditioning is turned on you have to put something in the hole in order to stop the cool stream.', 'stars': '4'}
{'review': 'Had a very comfortable travel. The Driver was cool & friendly, air conditioned worked well, the bus was neat. Overall had a good experience with Flexibus. Will travel again. I think it matters a lot how the Driver behaves, as for the entire journey he is kind of a host.', 'stars': '4'}

{'review': 'I decided to use FlixBus to get back to Hamburg instead of taking the train because it was one fourth the price of the train ride. The bus was clean, seats were reasonably comfortable and the ride ended up being shorter than originally anticipated, shorter than the train ride too. Only thing I could think of to criticize was the unpleasant smell of the coach restroom.', 'stars': '4'}

{'review': "It's a nice clean bus with wifi and toilet. However the legroom was to short, even for a short girl like me felt a little uncomfortable. The seat should be assigned accordingly and we should be able to choose the seat online during the booking on a first come first serve basis. I am with a group of 4 and we had to sit separated from each other for the very long journey. It doesn't felt good when you have to sit and sleep beside strangers.", 'stars': '4'}

{'review': 'Travelled with Flixbus for the first time, from Amsterdam to Brussels and back. I can certainly recommend it. Both ways, the ride was comfortable: enough leg space, good seats, easy check in procedure. Both times we left a little late, but we still arrived before the scheduled time. Probably helped that it was on the weekend. On the way to Brussels the driver was very friendly and gave a lot of information and the bus was very clean. The only downside was that the wifi did not work.On the way back, we did not get as much information, and there was still trash in the bus from the previous ride. On the upside, the wifi did work.', 'stars': '4'}

{'review': "I booked a return trip to Brussels for the weekend. It costed me less then half of what it would have cost me for train tickets (booked 2 months in advance), and I only booked it one week in advance.The bus was a bit late arriving at Arnhem. But this was due to traffic because it was the carnival weekend. The trip took about 3 and a half hours, which gave me time to charge my phone whilest taking a nap. We arrived in Brussels on time. On the return trip the bus was 40 minutes early, we left on schedule. Overal it was an excellent trip. Great to have USB-ports on the bus. And soon they will have wifi. I would recommend Flixbus to anyone who wants to travel to a neighbouring country, it may take a little longer then going there by train. But it's great value for money and very comfortable compared to both the train and travel by airplane.", 'stars': '4'}

{'review': 'Hello, my girlfriend and I have used Flixbus many times now and we are always amazed at the low price of travel, and the variety of destinations available - even to the "not so popular" tourist locations.I know it is difficult to plan for delays on the road, but it would be nice to receive an estimation of the delay (from previous trip statistics) on the app on the day of travel - this will ensure that a traveller could plan their connection a little more accurately.', 'stars': '4'}
{'review': "I made several journeys using Flixbus and found them to be cheap, reliable,  and very user friendly.  I liked the fact that there prices do not dramatically increase closer to departure time.  Services were generally on time (one exception was when I travelled to Brussels and there was a 45 minute delay but this was caused by traffic as it was rush hour).The only thing I would like them to change is rebookings.  I would like to be able to change/rebook from the App but this is only possible via there website.  I would also like it if they could replace the '15 minute before departure' rule for rebooking.", 'stars': '4'}

Sometimes there is announcements but often there is not, especially when there are delays which are not good for travelers who have connectind buses, or other transport. Overall flix is good for price, comfort and cleanliness bus when it offers all the extras if never flows through with these offers.", 'stars': '4'}
