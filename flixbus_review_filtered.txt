The trip pleasant without complications. The return trip turns complete opposite. The reason following: According plan, arrive 21:30 Ravensburg Escher-Wyss-Straße 9. We never reached stop. The bus driver left us 20:45 Bahnhofsplatz 5. His reason: At agreed stop many people walk underpass get back actual station. Unfortunately, several people (mostly women) sat bus walk exactly underpass due new location defined bus driver, car, bike, etc. parked right there. There say. On suggestion would arrive much earlier planned, quite possible continue approach planned final stop time answered sentence. "You\'re welcome get like it!". When I book trip reputable provider, I expect dropped agreed location. For I paid travel price. It may well great gesture let people another stop convenient / secure - still agreed destination still addressed afterwards. The passengers even asked case allowed walk luggage underpass scheduled arrival. Based time mail, certainly see let much earlier planned wrong destination. In itself, earlier arrival time problem. But not, considering way done: 1. The departure station Munich left 18:14 last registered passenger checked in. A passenger even forbidden go toilet checking last person, although departure time 15 minutes later. The statement driver "then stay Munich, suit you" .2. Despite 30 minutes earlier arrival time Leutkirch jumped driver leaving last passenger destination Leutkirch directly bus drove without asking. Had intervened time, would passenger wanted Ravensburg, "sit" remained wanted stretch legs. Again, bus driver fell sentence "we make fun event" ein.Ich personally problem short breaks. But arranged passenger everyone knows return bus. According plan, could 45 minute break. In case, proceeding without consideration examination. In company far I able hear primitive expression driver trip. This may also due non-existent separation driver passenger, case example railway. However, excuse way passengers communicate. 4. Had driver real interest well-being passengers, would have, already formulated above, intermediate stop station street would driven scheduled arrival. He would still arrived 40 minutes scheduled arrival. Due points, I clearly question professionalism Flixbus. Sure, may isolated case - I\'ve never experienced anything like it.

You may end never finding bus.2. If find bus, try keep luggage far inside cabin possible, keep eyes cabin whenever there's baggage unloading. In Brussels people bus stop literally waiting steal luggage arriving customers. If stuff gets stolen, don't expect sympathy assistance staff, because:3. The bus drivers, particularly Dutch ones reason, exceptionally rude, even hostile: bark instructions though customers animals. Really: don't speak; shout.4. Use bathroom boarding bus. The bathrooms dirty, unlikely toilet roll, everything going sticky urine. (The floors bus also dirty, plastic bags rubbish every aisle seat.)5. Bring fan. Ventilation unreliable.6. Bring torch. When say USB sockets seats, really mean ten thousand leagues sea(t).7. If you're UK-France trip, bring full meals. They unlikely stop Shuttle centre, owe nothing.

It turns out, find (through ticket office Gedser) reserved space bus departure at. 11.00 - is, departure Flixbus departure Berlin every single day.

Suddenly, information sign bus, bus canceled. Again INFO - everyone wildly frustrated. The Flix Manager comes five minutes, drive anyway. However, says German I ask happened - allowed drive "he would that". Not something calms passengers going 420 km. long drive.

He forgot communicate passengers, despite fact straightaway meant 3-hour delay minimum compared Eurotunnel route.We hours late arriving London night, top bus hit height restricting barrier driving tunnel! And driver didn't seem care, drove tunnel nothing happened!! We literally fearing lives driver drove two tracks, trying avoid crashing top bus wall tunnel either side. The driver lost plot completely: first drove straight City London, making tricky U-turn coming corner bus could manage. Then got lost right next Victoria Coach Station, drove us Brompton Road make another road-blocking U-turn Victoria & Albert Museum. From point fellow passenger helping bus driver phone Google Maps find destination... Finally arrived Victoria Coach Station, could laugh drive go international arrivals instead block away. Almost 5 hours late, another nerve-wrecking travel experience topped fear death, finally disembarked 22:15.Despite several complaints mail phone, day still haven't received formal apology refund Flixbus cancelled trip. The elusive customer service line total shambles, three attempts asking refund I received following replies phone, chronological order:1. transferred 5 working days (didn't happen)2. I didn't claim refund all, haven't registered anything3. lastly, transferred 4-6 weeks(!!!)", 'stars': '1'}

 {'review': "On 29th June I booked 5:45am bus Flixbus Dresden Central Berlin SXF airport, arrive airport 7:50am.I waiting bus stop 5:20am. This 5:45am bus never arrived. After 6 one guy telelephoned Flixbus us waiting bus getting anxious flights catch, told would another 10 minutes. At 6:30am 6:15am bus arrived 15 minutes late took us we're waiting. Once bus internet service all.Unfortunately us waiting 5:45am bus didn't arrive Berlin SXF 9:10am.For others boarding gate closed. I missed flight connecting flight Paris chance getting home afternoon. So overnight train journey full next day train 350euro pocket I finally arrived home next day 5pm.When I arrived home I sent complaint fact bus never turned I notified wasn't coming plus fact I paid 19 euro 5:45am bus 6:15 bus 12 euro I booked it. The reply back I allowed time flight send booking number could inform I hadn't notified delay. I reply since sent another complaint response. If bus arrived time delayed route Berlin due traffic problems accident , I could understand. But bus turn notification anyone would delay ...to totally unacceptable disgusting. IT WAS A BUS GOING TO AN AIRPORT course people flights catch.Reply FlixbusThanks reply Flixbus. I give phone number appears didn't go through. I 3 trips booked company week I gave number booking, ph number came two bookings doesn't appear one. Seeing buses travel long distances offer bus services airports. Maybe could bought customers attention making booking buses run 11/2 2hrs late due distance travel possibility traffic delays driver rest breaks. As I booked bus web site gave 3 departure time options 3.20am 5:45am 6:15am morning three buses arriving Berlin SXF Dresden morning arrival time 9am actual fact due traffic delays etc claiming? Supposedly early bus 3.20am would made 9am. Had I made aware fact prior booking I could booked earlier bus. There distressed people waiting bus 29th people miss flight.

A things aware you're considering booking Flixbus:1) The bus run extremely late, won't inform accurately. From Eindhoven Bruges, bus arrived 30 minutes late, way back, bus arrived hour late. In end, along 45 minute 'break' remote gas station despite fact running extremely late already, I arrived Eindhoven 2 hours later time given Flixbus.2) Nothing works.

The drivers laughing fact delayed 3 hours.My partner I another connection bus catch Victoria Coach Station departing 11am. We missed it, still bus drivers navigate correct arrivals area station. The communication bus drivers staff assisting giving directions, comical. The drivers\' English proficiency poor, staff member forced use simple baby English. When finally allowed leave bus, clear partner I missed connection bus.

On Flixbus however, I found several drivers unreasonable bullying approach asking put guitar luggage compartment.

 {'review': 'I travelled using Flixbus several times since moving Berlin February 2015. I find good alternative train. The buses always comfortable clean restroom, comfy seats, fully stocked snack selection. My last bus Flensburg also hot drink machine. I also appreciate power outlets FREE Wi-fi plus selection movies, stream smoothly. Here recommendations improve Flixbus:1. Clarify many stops point origin destination. When I traveled Flensburg, approximately 4 stops ticket said "Direct". 2. Instruct Driver\'s announce stop names. Often times, I going town I yet visited I know I arrived. Plus, maybe I would like come visit town travelled.3. Improve Delay notification - For part, Flixbus pretty punctual, delays happen...I want know realistic estimate time arrival. Update times necessary.4. Movies - (are AWESOME!) - would great one could easily determine dubbed original language.5. Bus stop arrival/departure signage/instructions - part, easy determine bus destination departing (especially Berlin), Dresden real challenge. It\'s wide spanning area I last travelled signs differentiating destinations (maybe updated?).Overall, small details. Flixbus best deal last minute travel within Germany based price, service, reliability. I continue highly recommend company.', 'stars': '5'}

 {'review': "For Older travelers Flixbus might provide good alternative trains making shorter hops cities Europe. The cost per mile approximately $.12-$.18 per mile. Distances longer 4 6 hours length probably best served flying. Entry Heights trains somewhat determined platforms. The height variance enormous country country even station station. It quite haul get luggage train depending factors. In general, train fares slightly expensive FlixBus. For part flick buses use central railroad station various cities serve. So getting departure point arrival area easy. One advantage bus storing luggage underneath rather haul train. Flick bus easy use smart phone application allows find routes purchase tickets smart phone. This convenient you're going making several stops Europe. It takes five minutes set application provide credit card. You either print hard copy ticket application ticket embedded get board bus show driver facsimile ticket Bob's uncle! The buses relatively new, clean seating comfortable probably comparable economy class plane seats. Maybe even little better. Do keep mind FlixBus mainly application based. That means arrive jump point buy ticket anyone communicate with. When bus arrives driver scan smart phone ticket self store luggage underneath bus. This self store idea probably least appealing heavy cumbersome pieces luggage. The bus driver assist. Schedule departures arrivals kept reasonably tight cases 510 minute variance would experience. A wide range people utilize FlixBus. So encounter young people old people aged folks. On several trips encounter children. Interesting. Free Wi-Fi generally available. Sometimes however encountered particular buses technical problems. Probably idea person MiFi communicate anytime want.", 'stars': '4.0'}

Here objective reasons think twice going them. 1. Customer service kicks office 12 midnight sharp.2. Locating buses confusing. There signboards whatsoever. 3. 24/7 hotline English speaking friendly. The English speaking hotline available certain hours. If dial 1 English hours, hang automatically. 4. Traffic jams happen twice. Even 45 minute lay enough catch connecting bus.
