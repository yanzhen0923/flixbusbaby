{'review': 'y\'all.i am OFFICIALLY DONE.after 8 years riding Bolt, I\'m done, done DONE. never again.i\'ve had multiple Bolt rides over the years, several times a year back and forth from NY to MD and back again. this last time takes the gotdern cake. and i\'ve had many issues, including being broken down and stranded on the side of the road for 2.5 hours, no heat, no AC, no wifi, no outlet power, buses being hours late...but this time. a few days before my ride back to NYC, i got an email that bus would leave an hour late. strange, had never gotten and email like this. so the morning i was supposed to depart, i called Bolt to make sure the email was accurate. customer service confirmed that yes, bus would leave an hour late.so. i arrived 20 mins early, no bus. 20 mins later, no bus. it was POURING this day, so we were all getting wet.once bus was 10 mins late, we called Bolt. we were put on hold three times and received information that our bus was CANCELLED. much to our surprise, as we\'d gotten no notice. (there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

So first trip we had a lady driver, she was all good. We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

The Bolt Bus staff was nowhere to be found. No one was there to greet or answer customer questions. Where were they? Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10).

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before.

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all.

Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues.

That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS. There was ONE really sweet Bolt Bus employee who managed the check-in. She tried to get me on the bus earlier, but the bus driver kept yelling at her not to let me on.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

Who does that...arrive in Philly at 4:45-ish and turn right around and get on a 5:00 bus, going back to NYC? Really, Bolt Bus?

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

The Bolt Bus staff was nowhere to be found. No one was there to greet or answer customer questions. Where were they? Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before.

I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization.

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all.

So first trip we had a lady driver, she was all good. We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

The Bolt Bus staff was nowhere to be found. No one was there to greet or answer customer questions. Where were they? Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues.

That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all.

We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver.

I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

Wifi is basically non-existent (oh, it's there but once you're connected, my phone just stopped loading stuff). The ac is not really working because it feels warm in this small space. I can smell the restroom from the fourth row before it. And the driver just doesn't care and is pretty rude in responding us. So i don't recommend it.

Who does that...arrive in Philly at 4:45-ish and turn right around and get on a 5:00 bus, going back to NYC? Really, Bolt Bus? Your website should at least, prompt as to whether you're sure these are your dates.

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all.

We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie.

Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all.

We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board.

Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie.

When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents.

We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board.

Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

So first trip we had a lady driver, she was all good. We left 6:30 in the dot, very punctual which is appreciated and she made a rest stop in Maryland.Trip back we had an amazing driver, called Ty I believe. He was just very informative and nice. We left 6:35 pm from DC because he said he liked to wait for a couple minutes in case someone was running late and told us to be understanding since we might find ourselves in that situation one day. I thought it was very thoughtful of him.Made another pit stop at Delaware on the way back and can I just say that I was totally amazed at how clean the bathrooms on both buses were?

The Bolt Bus staff was nowhere to be found. No one was there to greet or answer customer questions. Where were they? Huddled up warm inside the bus talking to each other for 30 minutes, while customers were outside cold & confused not sure what bus to board. At least Mega Bus has staff outside directing people to the right bus lines and answering questions. But what pushed me to write a negative Yelp review: The bus driver. Bus #0836.This bus has over 60 seats. It was 9:20AM on a WEDNESDAY, with only 5 people onboard. It was practically EMPTY, with obvious space for me to board. I was freezing, but would the driver let me get on? No. When I asked her why not she yelled back with a nasty attitude, "Rules are rules! Standby\'s can only board 5 minutes before departure time. Not one minute before. I\'m not bending the rules for you or anyone else!" \xa0 Why yell at me? I asked to board again at 9:24AM. Nope, she still wouldn\'t let me get on the bus. Meanwhile, another customer asked her a question about a bus to Boston. When the customer walked away she told the other Bolt staff, "That\'s not my problem." Long story short... Rude. Rude. Rude. When I finally boarded, we left with about 10 people on the bus. I recommend taking Vamoose Bus. Great customer service! Always departs on time. Staff is very friendly.PS.

We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}

When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10).

There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good.

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.

We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues.

(there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

{'review': 'y\'all.i am OFFICIALLY DONE.after 8 years riding Bolt, I\'m done, done DONE. never again.i\'ve had multiple Bolt rides over the years, several times a year back and forth from NY to MD and back again. this last time takes the gotdern cake. and i\'ve had many issues, including being broken down and stranded on the side of the road for 2.5 hours, no heat, no AC, no wifi, no outlet power, buses being hours late...but this time. a few days before my ride back to NYC, i got an email that bus would leave an hour late. strange, had never gotten and email like this. so the morning i was supposed to depart, i called Bolt to make sure the email was accurate. customer service confirmed that yes, bus would leave an hour late.so. i arrived 20 mins early, no bus. 20 mins later, no bus. it was POURING this day, so we were all getting wet.once bus was 10 mins late, we called Bolt. we were put on hold three times and received information that our bus was CANCELLED. much to our surprise, as we\'d gotten no notice. (there were 10 of us waiting..)we asked when there would be a bus arriving to pick us up and take us home, and she said she "didn\'t know". couldn\'t tell us. i found this unacceptable, so asked her to call someone to find out. the call got disconnected.called again. she said next bus would arrive in 30 mins. at that time, a bolt bus pulled up and parked far away in the lot, mocking us. i asked her if this could be our bus. she couldn\'t tell me. then she said, maybe it is. so we waited. finally, someone walked all the way across the lot to ask driver, he said, no, he was scheduled to leave in over an hour.mind you, it\'s still pouring. we are all wet and shivering at this point.the driver sees this.looooong story short, we stood outside from 3:30-5:15pm in the rain, no official email or notice or apology, and that driver sure did sit out there on that dry bus and stare at us in the rain until it was time for him to leave.our original bus time, 2:30, would\'ve landed us in NYC around 7pm. didn\'t get in until around 10:30pm.i\'ll try Best Bus next.', 'stars': '1.0'}
{'review': 'You get what you pay for. The service is basically non-existent, and once in a while you\'ll have a super surly driver or the person checking your ticket is having a bad day, but most of the time the people you interact with are bearable. As someone who at one point took this bus twice daily between NYC and PHL, I have to say they rarely run into issues. Just remember they\'re at the mercy of commuter traffic and have schedules to stick to. That means if your bus is late, but the next schedule is on time, you\'ll unfortunately have to wait for your bus. Also, the wifi basically never works, probably because 50 people are trying to stream music and videos at the same time!Riders, a few pieces of advice:- Know your boarding group (A, B or C). When B and C tickets crowd the front door, it makes the process longer and even more arduous.- Omg for the love of God just make a line!! Crowding the door, once again, makes the boarding process sooo much longer.- Sign up for an account! Their loyalty program is great If you take the bus often (you earn 1 free trip per every 10). When I use my account I also always get an "A" ticket, regardless of how little in advance I book my trip.- If you miss your bus, your ticket is valid on any other buses running the same route that day. Make sure you get in the standby line ASAP if you want to make the next bus.- That being said, standby passengers board 5 minutes before the bus leaves, so even if you have a ticket and you arrive after that, your seat is likely to be given away.Like I said, this is budget travel, so while you get what you pay for, it could be much worse!', 'stars': '3.0'}

{'review': 'This is my first time trying out BoltBus. My first impressions are as follow:Waiting for the bus:we got out of our cab and examined the scenery for a little bit. We were confused with the lack of line organization. The only visible indicator that we were actually on the line were the signs that were posted which showed our destination and several line dividers. As more passengers arrived It became clear that there was no line and people were just standing as close as possible to the bus door.Bus arrival:Bus was scheduled for departure at 12:30 instead it didn\'t even arrive until 12:50 PM(we departed at 1PM, 30 mins late.).Boarding:My first impression of this was also bad, as again there was no real organization. They just called up "Group A", "Group B and C", and everyone just kinda huddled by the bus trying to get in regardless of the group.Tech & Seating Experience:Wi-Fi: FAILChairs: DECENTCup Holders: FAIL (don\'t know who thought of elastic cup holders, but they fail) Overhead Air: FAIL (it wasn\'t blowing any air, and yes I opened it up for air flow)Riding Experience: Bus smelled like pee the entire time. There was a guy sitting to the seat directly behind the bus driver(well to his right, the first seat by the door) and his cell phone kept going off, at full volume and for some reason this guy didn\'t know how to lower it, or answer/deny the call despite the nice fellow beside him trying to tell him(repeatedly throughout the first hour or so) to press the green button to answer the call. The bus driver asked him to lower the phone several times but he never did (not that I think he knew how, but the guy seemed to not even notice his own phone ringing so who knows), the phone just would go off every 10-20 mins which became irritating. Within 2 hours of departure I noticed the driver getting agitated by the phone & glancing back at the guy.Bathroom Experience:I went to the bathroom before we even departed, I was second in line and by the time I got in there the toilet bowl was visibly full from the trip it had made just before. This is what(I\'m assuming) contributed to the awful smell.Driver Experience:Nothing bad, nothing good. The only thing I picked up was his agitation from the ringing phone, but that\'s not really his fault nor a bad thing towards him.-1 Star for the bus being late.-1 Star for disorganization-1 Star for the bathroom and smell-1 Star for the Shitty Cup holders, Wi-Fi and the ringing phone.', 'stars': '1.0'}

Who does that...arrive in Philly at 4:45-ish and turn right around and get on a 5:00 bus, going back to NYC? Really, Bolt Bus? Your website should at least, prompt as to whether you're sure these are your dates.

{'review': 'An absolutely awful, dangerously overheated ride on 5/19. We waited for an hour past the time we were scheduled to leave so that we could have a bus with A/C, we were informed, "so that we wouldn\'t sue Bolt". Prophetic? Remains to be seen.When we boarded our bus, we did in fact have A/C (although no Wi/Fi) for the first hour or two, but a short while later the bus had to stop multiple times due to an overheating engine. We were told there was some sort of fluid leak in the engine, possibly coolant. We were never offered the option of getting off the steaming hot bus to get some fresh air. The A/C was clearly broken and there was hot air pumping into the bus thru the vents for hours while it was already over 90deg outside, leading to many passengers turning red and feeling ill, *especially* those who were in the sun the whole time, since Bolt also does not offer the option of either opening a window or pulling down a shade. It was definitely above 90deg at the back of the bus where I was sitting, since the engine right behind us was pumping out heat constantly in addition to warm air from the vents. When we got off the bus ~3pm, 91deg outside felt significantly cooler. I would not be surprised if some of the passengers ended up with heat stroke. I myself felt nauseated and disoriented for the rest of the day. We arrived at least 2hrs after our originally scheduled time, and I\'m somewhat surprised we made it at all. The amalgamated bus companies of Greyhound, Coach, Yo!, and Bolt forced the smaller Chinatown bus companies out of business due to similar bus safety issues. If they are going to charge 2 and 3X what they ever did for tickets, the least this monopoly can do is offer safe service. These busses are clearly in such a state of disrepair that they are barely able to function safely. Amenities they advertise on the front page of their website and on Wikipedia are generally a lie. This is obvious false advertising, but I have not bothered to complain in general because I did not actually feel unsafe until this last ride.
