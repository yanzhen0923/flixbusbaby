No one to call to find out if the bus is late, or cancelled, or what.Luckily, my son had driven me to Oakland, so we drove over the bridge to the San Francisco stop, and there was the bus! I asked the driver - who recognized me from several previous trips - why he hadn't been in Oakland, and he tells me that he was, but that as of last Sunday they now pick up on 7th st out in front of the Bart station, no longer at the old stop behind the station!There was NO notice of this! No note in the confirmation email, no text of a new stop as they did when they moved the LA stop, no sign up at the old stop, NOTHING! Because of the layout, you can't see the new stop from the old one, so me and two others missed the bus in Oakland.

{'review': "Rode BoltBus for the first time after buying a living social deal ($20) for a roundtrip to LA. Pros:- New- 1 level - Trash bag adjacent to the wall of each row of seats. Very conveniently placed instead of it hanging off the isle like other buses. - Outlets!! Yes, they have two plugs in front of most seats. - Cup holder in front of each seat.- Clean bathroom that DOESN'T smell! It surprisingly smelled really fresh!- AC that WASN'T blasted. When I rode Megabus, their AC was 'broken' so I had to suffer 7-8 hours freezing, permitting me from sleeping at all. Worst bus experience ever.- Super nice and friendly drivers that actually want you to enjoy your Bolt experience. - Stored luggages/ bags based on your destination, that way you don't have to worry about your bags being stolen by the people who get off at earlier stops.- FAST & RELIABLE! Expect to arrive 30 minutes earlier than the expected time. Cons:- This is probably the only reason why I gave this 4 stars, but the wifi was very very choppy. I know you can't expect great connection for a bus, but I was frustrated even trying to connect to begin with. Having a more stable and solid connection would bump my rating to 5 stars.

But I suggest downloading movies before hand because netflix and video sites are blocked because they slow down the wifi. \xa0One thing I didn't like was the leg room. There really isn't much legroom and space to move around. If you get to board the bus first sit in the front, there is a little bit more space. It gets difficult to stretch or move legs when there's someone next to you. My butt was sore sitting the whole time and unable to move around.

The Bolt bus leaves from the Greyhound terminal in the temporary SF Transbay Terminal. There is a great Starbucks located a block away on Howard, so you can enjoy some coffee and purchase snacks before your trip. The Bolt bus boarded about 15 min. before departure.

One thing I like about BoldBus is that their is less people, probably because it is a new service in the West Coast by Grayhound to compete with Megabus. I also like the fact that their is a lot of legroom on these buses and the driver would also have knowledge on how to work the Wifi system if anything goes wrong.
