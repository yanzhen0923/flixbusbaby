The bus was 40 minutes late. We called their hotline and they Â DO NOT speak English!! We had no idea where the bus was or if we are at the right spot. We asked a German/English person speak instead who was waiting for the same bus. Everyone kept saying it was "coming". Finally after the 2nd phone call it arrived and we went on. Later finding out the back window was shattered, broken. They drove off regardless which was fine by me I just wanted to goto Prague. They made a big circle and 15 minutes we were back to the satiation we we're at! They signaled us to get off. We had no idea when we were getting back on or when the next bus was. From the other travelers I heard it was 15 minutes then also 2 hours!! We tried calling the hotline again and now the hotline was not valid. They had blocked our numbers apparently so all we can do was email. After 2 hours we heard from someone else they got an email. We checked our email and finally got some confirmation we got a revised booking for the 15:15 bus. Our original bus was suppose to be at 12:15. We finally got on but the poor others who didn't have internet connection had to wait for stand by and not know if they'll get on. I reassured they would because I looked at the booking and there was space. We all got shit seats but at least we're on our way. I will NEVER book FlixBus again. And get this, after I've already return from my vacation I get a text that they are sorry about our bus being in an accident and we are able to take the 13:15 bus 060 LIne. Use eurolines it's much more organized and you get an actual person to speak with at inform when we took our trip from Amsterdam to berlin. Or book the train.
