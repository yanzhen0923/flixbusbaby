The woman in front of me folded her seat just as well, so that I had even less space with long legs. She ignored my advice a short time later (Merci beaucoup!). By night I actually understand that the bus passes a certain distance and does not stop in every major city. Not so FlixBus! He stopped in Geneva, Lausanne (here in full Montour the light and 20 minutes break - seriously?) And Basel (again great light on). It was impossible to think about continuous sleep. The coronation was still that the bus driver from Freiburg i. Breisgau should actually change. This was nothing, because the replacement driver was sick leave and there was simply no substitute. Whether intentional or not, you could hear over the microphone the telephone conversation between driver and supervisor well and clearly in the back row. The bus driver sounded pretty exhausted. He had to continue until shortly before Heidelberg, where at least there a transfer could be made. Bus driver was - understandably - annoyed, the passengers, who arrived too late, were-understandably-also annoyed, heated accordingly was the conversation. The bus finally arrived one hour late in Frankfurt / Airport. My connection bus was delayed at first 1.5 hours and only after I had called in the service center, one noticed that the bus altogether at 2h45min would be late. The bus was again crackling, although I would like to sit alone after the long ride sometimes even to sleep. Instead of the expected 18 hour drive I was finally 22h on the way. If you stop at night in every major city, you could at least -generally also for a small fee- Blindfolds and Oropax offer, this did not appear. Someone like me, who sleeps well, does not think about something like that before the ride, but it is a good service. Vll you can also seat assignments, so that guests who are on the road all night to the terminus, can sleep in the back and not the whole bus the lights must be turned on.

{'review': 'The positive first: Flixbus stands out first and foremost by low prices and by occasionally functioning WLAN on board. Unfortunately, the Flixbus company treats its customers as if they all had no scheduling. In about 10% of all trips that I have made with Flixbus so far, there were no delays. These are not always communicated to customers, so you can also wait for hours at the stops. Trips are almost always planned so that the targeted travel times are not unsustainable. Regular driver changes are made during interim stops at motorway rest stops instead of stops, which is almost always time-consuming and as good as always longer than the announced "10 minutes". If an incident such as an accident or a defect happens, it can only be for hours until replacement is provided. As for the cancellation, I am also very dissatisfied. It has happened to me more than once that Flixbus has rebooked me for other trips because the booked trip has been canceled. Since these had never suited me, however, I was allowed to pay the cancellation fee to get a part of the price back. Whereby getting money back would be overpaid, because there is no money back. The company Flixbus finally dares to send only coupons.

{'review': 'Unfortunately, I can only report bad experiences with Flixbus. I had booked a ride on the Flix bus from Friedrichshafen to Munich and waited for several hours on the (according to SMS at 15 min.) Delayed bus at a published departure point, on the correctness of me several times by telephone at the service hotline as well as on the information on the website of Flix bus as well as the stop had seized. There were also several other people waiting at the aforementioned stop, who had also booked a ride on the bus I booked. After a long wait, without any information about another delay, I called again to the service hotline. There I was informed that the bus I was waiting for was already "long gone". Apparently, the bus driver had erroneously driven to the otherwise approached stop at the city station to accommodate the passengers, without wondering that there were no guests waiting there. Unfortunately, the service hotline did not tell me the cellphone number of the bus driver, despite my request, so that situation - which I had already feared - would not have materialized. As a result, I had a time delay of about 3 hours and had to spend high costs for the parking fees of my companion and run back and forth several times between the original stop and the other station with heavy luggage in blazing heat. Also in the aftermath Flixbus was unfortunately not cooperative and I stayed at the extra cost that had caused the wrong departure point information to sit. As a "compensation" I was on the part of FLIXbus, unfortunately without any apology (rather, the passengers were accused, that they would have waited at the wrong stop) a â¬ 5 voucher offered.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'This was definitely my last trip with Flixbus! Originally I was an absolute fan. I loved this uncomplicated way to travel because it was a cool and inexpensive alternative to the train and because the service was measured at the customer\'s request. Everything that did not bother anyone was allowed. If the bus was not too crowded, you could take a small suitcase in the passenger compartment. That was discontinued sometime. A pity, but no end of the world. A while later, the size of the hand luggage was mandatory. OK, I thought and yesterday packed a suitcase and a backpack for my personal belongings, which I did not want to lose sight of. Yesterday, this backpack was no longer allowed, so I had to carry laptop, mouse, charger, thermos, food box, water bottle, sunglasses, reading glasses, reading, wallet and last but not least cell phone loose in the bus. With these many (not quite worthless) items in my arms, I tried to show the bus driver my cell phone ticket. When I had finally taken a sweaty seat and took a short breath, an employee made me aware of the fixed at each place house rules, after which it is prohibited to place objects on the neighboring seat. So I distributed the things on the shelf, which is attached to the seat of the front man and at my feet, with the result that at every turn one or the other flew through the bus. In fact, I was already extremely annoyed when the sun burned my brain. I just wanted to draw the beautiful thick curtain when I discovered the sign on which this "for security" was prohibited. Unfortunately, I had already booked the return trip and was prepared for the worst. Also this bus was late, so I waited for the already 15 minutes, which one should be there earlier, another 15 minutes with about 100 other people (who of course did not all have the same destination) and in the rain. When the bus finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. Nobody refused to take my backpack with me, no one nagged me for placing it in the free seat next to me and there was no sign that said curtains were not allowed to close. I felt like riding Flixbus once before meant "freedom and adventure" and "warm welcome" was not just a slogan. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine in advance which subcontractor is being caught and whether the feeling of freedom and adventure dominates the journey or the feeling of "prisoner transport".', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'The drive from Munich ZOB to Zurich HB with the X06 on 29.05.2017 was a pure impertinence. It all started when two Flixbus employees tried to explain to travelers without identity papers why travel was impossible. Both travelers were friendly and quiet. It would have been enough for a worker to clarify the situation. The other could have regulated the entry. All in all we got on the bus with 15 minutes delay. No welcome or safety briefing at the start. Also no apology for the late departure. After 5 minutes drive to the highway entrance in Munich we stopped at an Aral petrol station. There was no information from the driver nor was the vehicle refueled, as far as I can tell. A woman got out and did not return to the bus again. We waited about 20-30 minutes for the onward journey. Again no apology or information. The onward journey proceeded calmly and without congestion. Shortly before the transfer from Germany to Austria, we were stopped by a police patrol who had not asked us to follow. The bus driver had the patrol car several times from behind by means of high beam. There was no request from the patrol officers to recognize that we should have followed them. And again we stood next time. Despite the fact that there was no traffic jam and no traffic congestion, we arrived in Zurich with a delay of 1.5 hours. Also that there was no internet connection, was by the driver (wortkarg) with a word mentioned or excused. Quite different the driver on the way from ZH - Munich, who communicated nice and friendly. Unfortunately, I could not accept this delay because there was a risk of being stuck in Zurich. After missing two possible options to get to my hometown by public transport, there was only one last train home that I luckily reached (3 minutes before departure). First of all, I have enough of Flixbus and will in future switch to other alternatives and use them.', 'stars': '1'}

The order in the InternetBanking marked as carried out and reduced the account balance by the entire amount. First I wrote an email -> within a day no reaction. Then I called there. A call to the customer service, which has already begun with the quality of the line being extremely bad, did not succeed. There I was told that no booking under my name, my email address or my phone number can be found and you can not help me. I should once again make the same booking and once again transfer the amount. Of course, I rejected that. Thereupon the information that a remittance represents absolutely no problem and I should contact via email / must be because by phone, no solution is feasible. That is really extremely bad. As a company, Flixbus could immediately issue a credit and I would simply have booked the tickets again and redeemed the credit. Since my last contact two days have passed. No news yet. Not even an email confirmation. Nothing at all. Maybe I am petty, but I expect nowadays that if a payment transaction is faulty and the entire amount has already been transferred, that I am immediately on the phone contact and helpful and offers a customer-friendly solution and I do not have my whole story write once by email, send and then have to wait again, so that I get my money back. For me, this was the first and at the same time the last attempt to travel with this company. After all, there are already many alternatives. In other complaint boxes is also reported by exactly the same error and the same procedure. I expect that my entire transfer amount will be returned without any further delays.

In the beginning I was very enthusiastic: Modern, comfortable buses, numerous connections, toilet on board, low prices and eventually even the WLAN started to work. Well, that the bus ever drove a detour to invite an additional bus driver, or that he did not want to start at the exit from Hamburg and the driver had to ring his replacement man on mobile phone on vacation, did not seem professional, has but not much changed on the positive impression. Once I had a complete microwave oven in the original packaging. No problem: stowed in the luggage compartment and not even paid anything for it :-) Therefore, I thought, I do not hear right, as the driver said, for my to send packed blender (53 x 32 x 27 cm) I should pay 9 â¬. Even DHL only charges â¬ 6 for that and has even more work to do. There was a handwritten receipt. Immediately complained to Flixbus and even sent a picture of the corpus delicti. Flixbus thought they could put me off with a standard answer, so check again. Result: Dear sir, [...] Thank you for your message.

{'review': 'Dear FlixBus Team, I write to you in the following concern: My friend has for the 08.04.2017 with the Flixbus a journey from Ravensburg to Munich (departure 07:10) and from Munich to Ravensburg (departure: 18:30 clock) for 3 Persons booked. The trip was pleasant and without complications. The return trip turns out to be a complete opposite. The reason for this is the following: According to the plan, we should arrive at 21:30 in Ravensburg at Escher-Wyss-StraÃe 9. We never reached this stop. The bus driver left us at 20:45 at Bahnhofsplatz 5. His reason: At the agreed stop too many people have to walk through the underpass to get back to the actual station. Unfortunately, several people (mostly women) sat in the bus because they had to walk exactly through this underpass due to the new location defined by the bus driver, because the car, bike, etc. were parked right there. There was no say. On my suggestion that we would arrive much earlier than planned, and it is quite possible to continue to approach the planned final stop before the time was answered with the sentence. "You\'re welcome to get out if you do not like it!". When I book a trip to a reputable provider, I expect to be dropped off at the agreed location. For that I have paid the travel price. It may well be a great gesture to let people out at another stop that is more convenient / more secure for you - but still the agreed destination should still be addressed afterwards. The passengers were not even asked in this case and we were allowed to walk with all the luggage through the underpass to the scheduled arrival. Based on the time of my mail, you can certainly see that we were let out much earlier than planned at the wrong destination. In itself, an earlier arrival time is no problem. But not, considering the way this was done: 1. The departure station Munich was left at 18:14 when the last registered passenger had checked in. A passenger was even forbidden to go to the toilet after checking in the last person, although the departure time is only 15 minutes later. The statement of the driver "then you have to stay in Munich, if it does not suit you" .2. Despite 30 minutes earlier arrival time in Leutkirch jumped the driver after leaving the last passenger with destination Leutkirch directly into the bus and drove off without asking. Had we not intervened in time, would a passenger who wanted to Ravensburg, there "sit" remained because he wanted to stretch his legs. Again, the bus driver fell only the sentence "we do not make fun event" ein.Ich personally have no problem with short breaks. But they should be arranged with the passenger so that everyone knows when to return to the bus. According to the plan, it could have been a 45 minute break. In this case, proceeding without consideration and examination. In no company so far have I been able to hear such a primitive expression of the driver as on this trip. This may also be due to the non-existent separation between driver and passenger, as is the case for example with the railway. However, this does not excuse the way in which the passengers communicate. 4. Had the driver had real interest in the well-being of his passengers, he would have, as already formulated above, the intermediate stop at the station street and would have then driven to the scheduled arrival. He would still have arrived 40 minutes before scheduled arrival. Due to the above points, I clearly question the professionalism of Flixbus. Sure, this may be an isolated case - but I\'ve never experienced anything like it. I have already reported my displeasure to the customer service (Ivona), who also wanted to leave a message from the relevant departments. I would not have spent the time taken by the driver to formulate this complaint. But a punctual delivery at the agreed place I would have been much dearer.Auch if this mail may cause nothing, I thank you for your understanding. Best regards from Ravensburg!

We were already at 15:30 clock at the stop, with us many other passengers.

Then we were still 45 minutes at the bus stop, another three buses have also rejected us and could not understand why the driver from the bus number 17 has not taken us. After a long phone call with the hotline, after a conversation with the travel agency stand you could not reimburse us, as well as give bus ticket for another bus. Travel agency lady said they only sell the tickets and unfortunately can not reimburse. Then call the hotline again, a woman Schengelia said she can not do anything and said we should write an e-mail to the company after a successful review, the cost will be refunded, because she has seen in the system also that other passengers as well have complained. The lady said we should look for another way as we come home today.

I had a small travel bag and two handbags and my backpack with laptop, food and drink (to be able to work on the laptop during the 4 hour drive and drink) and then I was again pointed out in a very unfriendly tone I may just take a hand luggage with you on the bus. I thought ok then I have the other handbag in the trunk done. In the end, my handbag with valuables and my backpack with laptop and drinks stayed with me. He began to argue with me loudly and insisted that I may only get into the bus with my purse and that he would have taken away punishment from me but it does not make it out of goodwill. It was of course in my face an annoyed gesture to recognize and have out of anger "old!" said. There was even louder and threatened me with "I will not take you now!" which I find absolutely the greatest impudence and in my opinion, not at all! This is far from a customer-oriented service. Afterwards I have learned from other passengers that this bus driver (20.01.2017 departure 8:30 route: Bamberg to WÃ¼rzburg) is apparently always very rude.

Next door was another Hal empty Flixbus, which drove to Berlin a quarter of an hour later.

{'review': 'The outward journey was easy. The return trip was a disaster. Our bus, which should pick us up at 10.30 clock in Salzburg, did not come. The next bus left at 12.30 pm to Munich. There we were not registered. The behavior of the bus driver was a joke. He was not interested in helping the passengers who had been waiting since about 10 o\'clock. After about 45 minutes of phone call with the hotline we were lucky and I could still rebook on this bus. Other passengers, who should have also driven at 10.30 clock, had less luck. In Munich, the bus to Zurich at 15:15 was fully occupied, so we had to take the bus at 16.15 clock. Although I had a printout of the transfer, we had to wait for all the other passengers to get in. It had to be "clarified" something else. Lack of friendliness and understanding of the bus staff was no surprise to me. So I had the "pleasure" about 4 hours to sit next to a strange woman, since only single seats were free. At 20.30 clock we arrived in Konstanz. The original appointment would be departure in Munich 13 clock, arrival in Constance 16.35 clock. When booking is indeed asked for a mobile number. Why were we not informed that the bus fails? Why did he fail? Why do I have to take care of a transfer? Zero service from Flixbus!', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I had to stop my stay in Prague spontaneously due to a medical emergency of my son at home. The outward journey from Vienna to Prague with the Flixbus was still impeccable, because I can not fault it at all. The return trip I had to rebook for the reasons mentioned. So late in the evening I changed the ticket for the next morning 5:10 am via the app. We were at the stop at 4:50. At 5:10 o\'clock the Flixbus on the middle lane with approximately 50 km / h without stopping simply drove past the station. Call with the service hotline: After 10 minutes somebody takes off and tells me that this was not the bus to Vienna. This would unfortunately be delayed and would arrive in 3 minutes at the stop. We are so relieved waiting for the next bus. After 3 minutes actually enters a Flixbus, which also stops. We get in and show our ticket, whereupon the bus driver informs us that he is not traveling to Vienna, but to Stuttgart.Zweiter call to the service hotline: After 12 minutes takes off another employee. This informs me that the bus to Vienna is on schedule. The original assumption has therefore been confirmed, the bus passing us would have been our bus to Vienna. My assumption: Because we did not transfer until the evening before, the bus driver did not look at the current passenger list anymore and obviously assumed that there would be no boarding at this station (we were the only passengers at the station) and easy The reimbursement request (the refund was promised to me on the phone) was not responded until I forwarded an email to the service email address. It was an automated mail, after which my application is now being processed (why this does not automatically go out after receipt of the refund request is beyond me). After that radio silence. So I ask again by e-mail. After almost 3 weeks I get the succinct answer that the bus stopped on schedule. But at least I get a voucher for the unrisen Reise.I summarize: (i) the bus to Vienna does not take us; (ii) the first service employee says, the bus was only late and would like to put me on the bus to Stuttgart (iii) the second service agent says "of course" I get the fare reimbursed; (iv) it needs a request via the homepage and two separate emails to break the radio silence and after 3 weeks get the answer that the Bus was stopped there and therefore the fare is not refunded. I then complained again, whereupon I was informed that (i) the bus lt GPS at the specified time has held there and even someone has entered and (ii) my application with a duration of almost 3 weeks anyway was answered extremely fast, because the standard processing time is 4 (!) Weeks. What should I say, a classic case of statement against statement. I can only take note of that. I have documented with photos (this also sent to Flixbus), where exactly we have been waiting (there even the Flixbusfahrplan was appropriate, on which also our bus connection was listed). If they say, GPS was the bus at the designated stop and somebody got in, then I was actually too stupid and waited in the wrong place, or the bus stopped somewhere else (although it\'s amazing, that afterwards the bus to Stuttgart stopped right there, the timetable hangs there and the driver told me on the way there, that the bus leaves for the return trip there (I asked him when getting out) .I leave it here and will be easy I would still like to tell you another "delicacy" (= GustostÃ¼ckerl) In the second answer from the customer service, they have made me aware that I should also pay attention, for the ride only paid 5 euros anyway because I have redeemed a voucher of EUR 30 for the ride, what exactly do you mean to say that I have the 35 euros voucher granted me for another trip I must be glad, because I would have received only 5 euros for a reimbursement, if 30 euros of the journey with a voucher were paid? Well, I would say, I have previously bought the voucher (if you rebook, you have to cancel and get for the canceled trip a voucher which you can then redeem when booking the new trip). So, if the business work as in customer service, then this company manages much faster than expected. In this sense, "save nerves, train ride". Many success still the company and good luck to future passengers!', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "Update (January 2017): Even after a further 6 months still no solution through Flixbus. Emails are simply ignored. The customer service is miserable. When I drove to Berlin about two months ago, I drove for the first time in a long time with Flixbus again. The prices are indeed in comparison to a flight or train driving already very tempting. At first I was very positive, everything seemed very efficient, although we were a little late, but I thought to the cost savings, you can take that into account. I already told some of my friends how great Flixbus is. But then came on the return journey to Konstanz the angry awakening. When I arrived in Konstanz my luggage had disappeared from the storage room. Value well over 500 EUR. The following points suggest in my view that the loss of luggage was ultimately caused by Flixbus personnel: 1. In a telephone call with the Flixbus customer service I was told that normally the baggage is sorted by the driver sorted by departure depending on the destination, so that there is no misunderstandings when clearing out. This was not the case in Berlin. There the driver did not give any luggage, this was done by every passenger.2. The driver of the section from Munich to Konstanz has informed me that the luggage space was empty when he took over the bus in Munich and he obviously (for a reason I did not see) was emptied by Flixbus staff, with my backpack not cleared back has been. The driver also informed me that for longer stays it is recommended to take the luggage out of the bus and then give it back. This was also not communicated to me before. Now it is not over. A mistake can always happen, especially since the drivers have a noticeably high pressure. The real sad thing about the story was the subsequent contact with the customer service. First, I had to wait almost two weeks until I was informed by the lost property office that my luggage has not appeared in Munich. Why this lasts two weeks is beyond me. No further comments, nothing. Upon further inquiries, I was finally asked to inform me about another request via the contact form on the website for damages. There I described the exact situation, attached a list of the lost luggage items with value and then simply also on several queries NOTHING more of Flixbus heard. That's over 6 weeks ago. Even on telephone inquiries is simply abgewimmelt with the excuse that there is no contact person with whom could be connected, I could only submit my requests via the contact form. That brings me a lot if these disappear in Nirvana. The really sad thing about the story is that Flixbus is a company that would have had a lot of potential in my eyes, but sooner or later it will fail. It did not understand that in today's world, a company will not have a long-term existence that treats or ignores its customers. Low prices ok, we all want them, but then better 10% on it and make sure that a minimum amount of customer service is maintained. So Flixbus will sooner or later be able to hold only those customers who are absolutely dependent on the low prices. Customers who have the choice, like me, will fall back on other options and dodge competitors (which will sooner or later certainly give it back because they are invited to such a service deficit in the market!) With me Flixbus has now lost a fan or almost a brand ambassador. I had already raved about Flixbus as I said and recommended it to my friends and yoga course participants. After this experience I have to strongly advise against Flixbus, at least for longer distances with intermediate stops. At least until such problems are solved more professionally. I probably continue to drive on short distances where I can travel without luggage.", 'stars': '1'}

After contacting our bus driver 2 hours before our original arrival time (to make sure we could reach our connection from flixbus in Antwerp), we were assured that all measures were taken to guarantee our transport to Groningen.However, on arrival there was nothing to assure this and our busdriver left us behind. After not being able to reach Flixbus for two times 15 minutes, we were told by a busdriver (Flixbus) to have some food and try again later. Later also did not help and we were left on our own for 1,5 hours after which we had to arrange our own stuff to try to reach our destination.Furthermore, we tried to cooperate with 5 flixbus drivers.

{'review': 'Last week I took Flixbus from Amsterdam to Leverkusen. Unfortunately, the behavior of the driver in no way corresponded to the quality of service advertised by Flixbus.1) When boarding I should stow my luggage (a small backpack) according to the driver under all circumstances in the luggage compartment. Even when I pointed out that I was allowed to take the backpack on the way with ease on the bus and he contains many personal valuables, I was merely insulted, "probably not read properly", it would eventually be all in the guidelines , Quite apart from the fact that the open luggage space is not monitored by anyone (which Flixbus does not care, they are not liable for lost luggage), I thought it was a bit strange, as both the passengers in front, as well as behind me with their backpacks were allowed and these were sometimes much larger than mine. 2) As I got out of the car, I realized that a passenger sitting in front of me had left something behind. It was a very valuable headphone. When I wanted to give the piece to the driver, this was only to understand that he did not care what happened to it and I should just keep the headphones for myself. Overall, I can recommend these events and similar testimonials of other passengers to anyone with Flixbus, Mein-Fernbus etc. (now almost everything belongs to them). I always thought train driving was frustrating, but Flixbus sets there again a drauf.Zur answer from Flixbus here below the following: I had already written to you and described the above points in detail. I also asked you to locate the owner of the headset. But there was only a "standard answer", which suggests that my mail was not even read. Literally the answer looked like this: Dear Flixbus customer, thank you very much for your message. On our homepage, we have collected the most frequently asked questions from our customers. You can read this easily under the following link www.flix ....

{'review': 'To be insulted by a bus driver, you only experience that at Flixbus. Many say the service on Flixbus leaves something to be desired. No wonder, I always thought - at the dumping prices you can not really expect much. But what I experienced from Vienna to Munich on Monday, on the way to or before the start of the journey at 17:15, still leaves me speechless. It all began with waiting customers who behaved well enough to show their ticket to the bus driver. An obviously bad-tempered bus driver replies my "hello" only with an ice-cold "ID". That\'s what I call a good start to a common 6-hour trip: giving the customer a feeling, as if he has just committed a crime. Well, thank God, it goes even further. Delivered suitcases with colleagues, I ask them if I should take the Zara shopping bag with 2 jackets on board or he stows them in the luggage compartment. "Just take it with you" answers this friendly. Said done, I climb the bus and hear after felt 3 steps a "Hey Sir". Amazed, I turn around and see an angry bus driver who really yells at me "What\'s that? That belongs downstairs ". Meant was my shopping bag with 2 jackets. On my answer that the colleague said I should take this on board, follows the next blow. "Then stash them in the jacket pocket and woe dangle a sleeve or something." Perplex as a 34-year-old marketing manager to be treated like a "stupid" schoolboy, it\'s enough for me now and I answer the bus driver "Certainly not in this tone". Not a good idea, I noticed at the same moment. Because this is followed by a "That\'s enough!" And the bus driver rips the shopping bag out of my hand and hands it over to my colleague. In order not to escalate the situation further, I decide to let it pass through my mind - but ask for the name of the bus driver to officially complain about him. "You certainly will not get it. Just write Flixbus from Vienna to Munich at 17:15 "replies this cynically. Well, enough, I think, to find the "blackest of all sheep among the bus drivers". As I open my MacBook to begin my complaint, I hear the bus driver cursing in the background. "We already know that. Big mouthpiece and nothing behind it "or" At Flixbus, the driver still decides who can ride and who can not. "Are a few of the niceties that fall.

{'review': 'I decided to try Flixbus for a chance with the nightbus between Copenhagen to Rotterdam, but will never travel with them again. First off, the bus (Together with 2 other Flixbusses with different destinations) was delayed by 45 minutes. Because we still had to get onto the bus aswell, we ended up leaving far too late.The promised internet was availible on the bus, but wasn\'t working. After politely asking the bus driver if he could help getting it to work he replied whilst smiling, and I quote: "Flixbus probably doesn\'t have the money to pay for the internet connetction to work on this bus, so I won\'t be able to help you with that". During the drive, the temperature in the bus rose to 26 degrees celcius. After repeatedly asking to turn the temperature down(by multiple passengers), finally they agreed to change the temperature down, only to let it rise back up to 25 degrees again about an hour later.Following to that, we stopped twice unnecessarily. We stopped, the busdriver got out, walked to a private car, and started unloading food, drinks and other personal stuff from the car into the bus, only to unload all the stuff again into another personal car, after we had crossed the Dutch border for the second unnecessary stop. This delayed the trip by yet another 30 minutes whilst passengers were waiting in the bus. As far as I am concerned Flixbus is in passenger transportation, and NOT a glorified goods transportation company, but I might be wrong...After 2 extra unnecessary stops and a total of an hour delay, the busdriver thought it to be nessasary to stop an aditional time just 1 hour outside of Amsterdam, because, and I quote again "He felt like drinking a coffee". After several passengers complained about the delay, he told us to "just call the costumor service if we didn\'t like it".In summary the service provided by Flixbus was appaling. The bus arrived 45 minutes late, the promised services (such as wifi) wern\'t working, we stopped unnecessarily 4 times(on top of the compulsary driver changeovers) and arrived over an hour and a half late.

{'review': 'Flixbus has replaced the well-functioning small private bus services that take passengers from Tegel Airport to Szczecin. The company and its infoline do not understand the difference between an airport transfer and a regular stop. Passenger aircraft accepted and accepted a slight delay in departure due to the delay of the aircraft because everyone can meet it. This is how the Aiport transfer works. If Flixbus does not understand it, it is better to remove the Berlin TXL stop from the distribution and return to the flexible airport transfer. The price of the ticket (Berlin center - 7 Euro, TXL-11 Euro) indicates that Flixbus distinguishes passengers from the airport for an additional fee but does not give anything in return.

An hour later, I and three other passengers still sat in Dusseldorf - no trace from the bus.

{'review': 'I have just booked a ticket with a voucher, which I bought on ebay for whopping 50 euro. When I saved the booking, I then found that the date was wrong (departure at 1am, which means I accidentally booked one day early). The customer service then told me you can not help me, the ticket is neither refundable nor rebookable. I can understand that offers are not repostable, but that one is immediately stamped in case of errors in the booking, I think harsh. So far I have taken Flixbus twice, both times at night the route Rome-Munich. For someone who is 1.90 tall, the comfort is zero. Internet on the bus is advertising technology a great idea, but for me it has never worked properly (but was expected). I also do not understand why people have to take off their shoes even though it says in Arabic that they should let it. Ergo: if you are short of money, really have no choice and have to book at the last moment, buy a ticket on Ebay and take Flixbus (but be careful when booking). Otherwise, booking an early plane or train is often cheaper and much more comfortable for long distances. Hello Carlos, good to know Flixbus apparently has staff who do nothing but answer ratings, even on Sunday. The voucher was not a gift, I think I have the right to the promised performance for which I have paid, albeit indirectly. Rebooking is one thing, help with booking another.

The bad thing happened afterwards. I have repeatedly called the customer service and rarely came through, which is a joke with a paid hotline. Unfortunately, a transfer to a connecting bus that I would reach was no longer possible, I would have had to wait 7 hours for the next ride (which was not possible, because I had to go to a job interview). I was kindly promised by a customer service representative and her supervisor. Flixbus will cover the costs of the train journey for the remainder of the journey. The next day, I sent all documents required to cover the costs (in the original) by post to the Flixbus central office. Approximately 8 weeks after sending, I kindly inquired about the whereabouts of my money. I was put off by the fact that my documents had been received, but the processing took much longer.

Arrived in time in Nuremberg, I had about one hour big window and went to the main station, but was already 20 minutes before the departure time at 6:50 at the bus stop on Willy-Brandt-Platz (where I had previously arrived, also as a ZOB known). When the bus had not arrived at 7:15, I started to worry, because I was not allowed to delay too late not to miss my flight. Call the customer service quickly to find out how long the bus should be late. To my surprise, I was told (and thus also another passenger, who was waiting with me) that the bus to Munich Airport is happily driving and that I missed the bus (which is impossible, as I am in the time window 6:30 - 7 : 15 was in place). Since this explanation of the client advisor obviously did not correspond to the fact, I can only guess what actually went. I hope for Flixbus that it was a delay that was not properly handled by the system. Otherwise that would mean that the bus simply did not drive up to the stop in Nuremberg. So much for this ride.

The bus driver was friendly and helpful and when all the other passengers boarded was also immediately started. The ride over was really relaxed there were only very small mini jams but these were quickly overcome. But then just before Hannover where the second stop would be, the bus turned to a gas station and the driver left the bus to look at the driver's side to anything. He took pictures which amazed me and then hastily phoned. We passengers looked weird then and the phone call took about half an hour. But when the bus driver got back on the bus and explained what was going on I fell off the chair. The bus driver told us that he had just phoned his boss to report to them that the bus front had a puncture and it would be better to organize a replacement bus. But the boss had told him on the phone that everything was fine with the mature and he should not do so. I as a passenger and also my companion did not feel well at all because of something like that and also some passengers said that they would get off here.

Finally arrived in Hanover, our bus trip was canceled first but it should already be a replacement bus on the way to take us to Hamburg Hbf.

{'review': 'Hello! My experience with Meinfernbus / Flixbus-> no "real" customer service availableBus travel was ok, but customer service in advance of the booking was a disaster. If you have a refund request or a faulty booking that you want to cancel (the booking system is not mature, especially with previously purchased Lidl vouchers for Germany-wide trips) then you get 2 weeks no answer, even if you send the mail 3-4x over several days, it is based on gross ignorance and only if you "pressure" and sets a deadline and threatens with legal fees then you realize that the customer service reads the emails every hour but very quickly, sometimes even within 10 minutes intervals, but then only tries to talk the customer out of claims, everything is so "bent" so that the customer receives no credit / refund. Basically, money is not given back for faulty tickets, even if this is against German law. At the end I filed criminal charges for *** against Flixbus / Meinfernbus, one is deceived as a customer and it is only about the avoidance of claims of the customer. No Euro should go back to the customer. The procedure runs against Meinfernbus / Flixbus ... Conclusion: Customer service of the above merged companies (both service departments are probably closed together, same procedure) is only to defend against claims ... even the Deutsche Bahn is much more customer-friendly and accommodating with problems and sticks to most the law. Will look in the future rather early for low rates at the Deutsche Bahn or looking for long-distance bus companies to offer the service, because it quickly goes wrong something when booking and otherwise the money is gone ...', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Miserable first ride and first experience. I drove from Bremen to Berlin last week on Thursday. The bus came from Amsterdam and was already 40 minutes late before I got in, as on the border apparently the passports and staff were checked. As you already got started you noticed, that the air was different. This smell was then confirmed very often just before Hamburg when the bus was stopped by customs and lots of things were confiscated (I hope I do not have to call them). Alone, this was already another 2.5 hours late. Then came on the highway a full closure and then an accident. Actually, I should arrive at 9 clock, but this was about 14:15. At the bus station at the Flixbus I was then assured that, because of these inconveniences, I would be able to give 2 free rides to the call center but not on site. There I immediately called the next day. My case was under investigation, and it was said that this was not Flixbus\'s fault, but that it had been a "higher power," even though airlines and the like were also responsible for weather delays and other delays. I then wanted to talk to the supervisor of the call center, but this was busy at the time, but it was said that they can call me back on my number already deposited, this unfortunately did not happen, so I tried again today, however This company seems to continue to feel no responsibility, so I am deeply disappointed. I had my return already at 17:30, so that only about 3 hours left me in Berlin.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'After reading positives on long-distance buses in the "Spiegel" and the "Zeit", I have been driving professionally from Hannover to Hamburg every week for a few weeks. In the course of the booking process of Flixbus, the mobile number is queried so that you can be notified in case of delay via SMS. Today I had made extra work two hours earlier to catch the 16:25 Flixbus to Hamburg. The display at the ZOB, Hannover showed a delay of 40 minutes. I had not received a text message about the delay, just as on Friday of the previous week when the Flixbus had an hour delay. By SMS, I was only informed about the appearance of the bus. After waiting for 40 minutes, I asked the Flixbus employee with the artificial fingernails and black hair (unlike her colleague, she did not want to say her name, was she ashamed of Flixbus?), Call the head office to ask when the bus would arrive finally at the ZOB is. I had heard from other guests that the delay would actually be 1.5 hours. Absurdly, she was only allowed to call her control center after another 10 minutes delay, she let me know. The bus she could not track, the navigation device was probably broken. Neither did she call me a responsible person, nor did she let me call someone in the control room who was responsible for the information chaos. She just referred to the customer service and claimed that the bus was right there. Meanwhile, the 16:15 Flixbus to Hamburg, which was also late, arrived in Hannover. With a burning cigarette the bus driver ran through his bus! Although there were still places available, he was not allowed to take along the passengers waiting for the bus at 4:25 pm. (At Lufthansa it\'s different.) There was no substitute bus provided. Finally, the delay was 1 hour and 40 minutes. Although our bus driver had already informed the control center about the delay at noon, the passengers were misled with a delay of 40 minutes. An SMS with the actual delay, we did not get. Also on the website there was no hint. Delays of buses can happen through accidents and traffic jams, I had already experienced in the previous week. What annoys me so much is the lack of information or the misleading by false information. If I had timely knowledge of the real delay, I would a) work in the warm office and thus make money or b) can travel by train to Hamburg, instead of standing around for hours in the cold on the ZOB Hannover.Und on top I get despite multiple request please no customer service bills for my Flixbus rides before the merger with MeinFernbus.

Compared to other services, the bus drivers of FlixBus do not have a list of passengers. So you would not have been able to call me. More serious, however, is that this makes overbooking possible (happened to me on the outbound MÃ¼nster-Siegen). Like those people who can no longer find a seat on the bus, then arrive at their destination is their own problem. When reimbursing, do not assume that you respond individually to your concerns.

{'review': 'I booked my return trip from Berlin to Nuremberg this weekend. Scheduled departure was at 13:00. We were punctual at half past 2 at the ZOB like many other passengers as well, but unfortunately the bus was far and wide no trace. We were informed for half an hour about nothing until after three quarters of an hour but the explanation came that the bus is in a traffic jam. So far everything is fine. But when he was finally there the bus driver said he still had to take a three quarters of an hour break because he came from Rostock. That too is understandable but what happened after that is a bottomless impudence! In the bus there was a total of 51 people. The problem was that this bus had more than 51 people booked so we could not accommodate all. The solution of the bus driver was finally to let so many people on the bus, as places were available and the rest could think on good German even as they should come home! Although the company takes over the cost of trains, but not ICEs, which would have been the only way we had returned to Nuremberg. Fortunately we had managed to get a seat but there was a family and more people in Berlin with no idea how they should come home! Scheduled arrival was in Nuremberg at 18:55 we were finally at 22:15 in Nuremberg and on a Sunday! The whole with the overbooking seems to have already been on the way to Berlin, as otherwere told by passengers. That something like that happens, that you can sell more tickets than there are places and can not happen! I will never drive with this company again. So really. It was just a bottomless impudence!', 'stars': '1'}

After 2 hours delay, 2 bus changes and finally an additional hour delay on top of it, I'm just glad that I had great passengers who made the trip more enjoyable. And as if all that was not bad enough, is on the way back also without traffic jams and breakdown an hour late, where I ask myself, where did it come from?

The bus did not depart Rouen until 19:25.We arrived in Paris around 21:10.

He told us to get help from the service girl in green shirt on the platform, some distance away.  By the time we chased down this service girl, she wanted to talk to the driver.  The driver was gone by this time.

{'review': "I was planning to take a bus for a weekend from Krakow to Vienna to visit a friend of mine. I found my bus 15 minutes ahead of time as instructed (despite the station not posting anywhere where it would be - this is likely the fault of the station and not the bus line, and does not factor into this review, though I was at the station an hour early and was just barely able to find the location in time because of this). I waited right outside the bus with my ticket and passport ready, waiting for the driver to start the boarding process, but this never happened - the bus just left with about 2 or 3 passengers who I would guess got there even earlier.I wasn't the only passenger who was left stranded at the station, there was another group who was supposed to get on the same bus and was left behind by this driver.In my experience, the bus driver should have been waiting outside the bus from at least twenty minutes before departure and not go back inside until the scheduled departure time.

{'review': 'Let me tell you, the trip was a debacle. Our bus crashed into the back of a car on the autobahn, so we spent quite a while on the side of the highway whilst the cops came and sorted it out. During the entire crash process and aftermath, not a word was spoken to the passengers to tell us what was going on. The drivers completely ignored us and acted as though this was totally normal. As far as I know, the bus drivers didn\'t speak Danish, English, or German, I only ever heard them speak in another language that I didn\'t recognize.The driver seemed to want to compensate for the delay caused by the crash, by speeding to speeds that no bus should go, and overtaking everything in his path, which was pretty terrifying. I couldn\'t actually see the driver\'s speedo gauge to say for sure, but I could swear that we were driving over the legal speed limits at times, on parts of the trip with 100kmph limits.We nearly crashed at least two more times because our driver tried to just merge into the side of cars on the autobahn instead of waiting for a gap big enough for the bus. The bus had zero Wifi access, but at least the bus had plugs for charging. There was a toilet on board, but when I went to use it (about 3 hrs into a 12 hr ride) the floor was a pool of urine. I\'m not talking a little dribble here, I\'m talking a pool, where there was no dry space on the floor to step in order to avoid it. I\'m not sure if that was due to the toilet not being cleaned when it was meant to be, or if it was just due to the men on board not being able to aim properly. Either way, getting wee all over my shoes wasn\'t terribly fun.I honestly thought that I might die on that bus ride due to the maniacal driving, which isn\'t really what you want your customer\'s experience to be, and you certainly wouldn\'t want them spreading that to others via word of mouth."Oh mate, how was your bus ride?"

Customer service was also unavailable - even after sitting in line on the phone for over half an hour, which also seems unbelievable, given that it was in the middle of the night.

Staff is unfriendly, swearing at people, they do not speak english most of the time. When we were traveling to Croatia, we had to pass borders with Slovenia. The problem was, there were two guys, that were most probably refugees without traveling documents- they let them in the bus anyway. So we were waiting for hours on borders because of them.

{'review': 'It is then a world unlike Redbillet to drive with Flixbus. I have been driving Flixbus a couple of times and each time with delay. When I went on Friday with Flixbus from Copenhagen to Randers, the trip was scheduled to last 4 hours and 55 minutes. Red car took normally 5 hours. Flixbus drove from DGI city on time, but before all passengers in Copenhagen had picked up, the bus was delayed and when we reached Frederica the bus was delayed 50 minutes. There were 3 driver changes before reaching Randers, which also did not reduce travel time. Drivers who felt the pressure of the delay and more traffic accidents on the highway drove a bit and forced to detract to avoid traffic jams. It did not seem as well thought out as one of the drivers suddenly turned out at high speed. A little uncomfortable. The journey from Copenhagen to Randers came to last 6 hours and 10 minutes. A journey where, as with Redbillet, there is no one-stop break where passengers had the opportunity to stretch their legs and get to the toilet. Why can not this be the case with Flixbus? Ok, you can use the toilet in the bus, but here is a bad room, there was no toilet paper, no soap and only the same towel everyone could use. When we reached Randers we were unable to drive to the destination of the bus because of cycling but was put in another place in the city. This was not reported on the bus, so only those who were asked to ask the driver knew about this outlet. It caused a little confusion and I had to take what I did not take into my calculation. I also experienced when, before my trip, I would change my ticket that it should first be canceled, which cost a fee of 10 kr. You have to think before purchasing a ticket with Flixbus. It can quickly become expensive if you want to make changes. At the same time you should have good time, great patience and not have too many appointments the same day. There is a difference between the quality and service of Redbillet and Flixbus, and I can not recommend the bus.

{'review': 'My boyfriend and I have been waiting for more than 2 months to get our money. How did that happen? We were happy back in February, booked four tickets at Abildskou from Aarhus to Hamburg for our vacation in July. During the spring, Flixbus Abildskou will take over. There is nothing in the way of it. Until ... My girlfriend is a little worried about the days up to the holiday because of the great holiday traffic in Germany so she persuades me to call Flixbus to hear their opinion about the traffic conditions - after all, they must have the experience and know if we can expect to be delayed when we are going to fly on a flight from Hamburg. I get their "customer service" and give us our booking number, which they say "that number does not exist". But, I say, I\'m sitting and reading high directly from the mail I received with the following booking number ... "It does not matter because our booking numbers start with 81XXX" and if I\'m reading right ?? Okay, lady, listen right here. I have received an email and it is quite clear that the booking number is YYY. "Nayyyyhhh, that\'s probably because, Abildskou used numbers other than us. Let me just look up ... "Hmmm. Thus, after 7-8 minutes of conversation, we arrive at the fact that we have probably booked a trip for 4 people from Aarhus to Hamburg on 8 July. Then the bomb bursts. The very insistent service team, who will be right, tells me that they are not driving to Hamburg on the day we have booked tickets. What ?! I ask why they have not contacted us and informed us this? They can not just cancel a trip without giving notice, to which I am told that "I could only have called and asked!" Sorry, what please? !! From there, it only goes down the hill ... After gaining all my willpower for not responding again to the inconvenience, I try to get the person who should service, to suggest alternatives and hear about solutions - we must place in 1 day and have to fly ... However, there is no help getting over the next 20 minutes in the phone. We are informed that we can return our money, but must apply for it on their website (we have cancellation insurance) - as the service person will not send us a link. We must try to find ourselves. The day ends with the fact that we send a money-back application to Flixbus, booked DSB tickets to Hamburg, go on holiday and forget about Flixbus for a couple of weeks. But ... Back in Denmark while enjoying the holiday memories, it comes to us that we have certainly not received our money from Flixbus. We therefore contact them on the phone. This is the second time we experience the most unnecessary service person we have ever experienced. The person "can" first finds no information on us and he has never heard that you can get money back. However, after patiently explaining to him all of our history, he finds out for a long time (one block later) that our case is at their economics department. We ask if he would be kind to look at how far the matter is with them? But he can "really not help us," he is not employed in their finance department, right? We can call them and hear if we want to know more. "Ok. Can you give us the number to the finance department? "No, I have not. You can google if you want to talk to them. "Deep breathing ... We find (yourself!) An email to the finance department and write to them to hear what the status is. After a few mail correspondence back and forth, we are told that "Flixbus is happy to inform us that we can get a Voucher (proof of payment) that we need within a year in their buses." It was right here, I detonated the first time. We have bought a trip they can not deliver. They cancel and not inform us about it. Only by chance we find ourselves out of it. We are promised to get the money back from their "service employee". We have even bought cancellation insurance, so there should be nothing at all about ... My dear girlfriend, however, is able to keep me calm so that we are writing back to Flixbus that this is in no way satisfactory and explains the above. Then comes the next Slavic mail correspondence, where Flixbus returns to us by mail (like 1-2 weeks of response) to get more "information required" such as booking number, bank account, travel information, etc. Long after long, we receive the following "" We\'re now going to refund the amount of $ 1,119.15 within several working days. "" Several "will last, after one week we receive 887 kr. It\'s now a month ago! Where are the last 232 kr., We should have returned?!?!

Our names are Claudio P. and Mariangela C.On 8 th September, we were standing at the Flixbus stop in Rotterdam (bookingno. 8.....9) when we received an email informing that the bus was 3 hourslate. We, like the other passengers waiting for the same bus, read this email only45 minutes later as we didnât have internet access. Maybe through a textmessage would have been better. We then bought 2 train tickets for Eindhovenspending â¬ 38 extra. Just so you know, we didnât receive any kind of assistance,any emails offering a refund. According to your terms and conditions, we shouldbe entitled to be refunded in full.The following day at 9.35 we took the bus 080 riding from Eindhoven to London(return tickets 8....5) scheduled for 9.20 am. After 10 minutes, the buswas stopped for the driver changeover. The real problems begin from here. Afterleaving Eindhoven, the bus started to release a foul-smelling. Some passengerscomplained and the driver explained us his colleague didnât empty the tank; wecouldnât use the toilet for the entire journey. Ok, itâs a low- cost service, but atleast you can prevent your customers from getting sick.We were approaching Antwerp and the driver complained the GPS didnât work.He didnât know how to reach Antwerp bus station; the navigation system kept onleading him to the wrong direction. People tried to communicate with the driverbut he could speak only French. Just a quick remark, the GPS was setting toDutch Language and I have the doubt the driver couldnât understand directions.Finally, a lady who had to be dropped off at Antwerp Bus Station, guided thedriver to destination. Some passenger became nervous, we were facing anaccumulated delay of about 2 hours; a man, who needed to reach Brugesshouted at the driver and the police was called. They spent at least 20 minutesto try to calm down the furious passenger.Same situation and same problems to reach Bruges and De Panne stations. Thedriver lost the control of situation. He was visible stressed and didnât have a cluewhere he had to go. He committed some traffic and driving offences: he used hismobile phone to liaise with Flixbus Headquarter, he failed to stop at traffic lights,he ignored zebra crossings making things dangerous for pedestrians, he stoppedthe bus on the city tram tracks in De Panne... do I have to carry on? Somepassengers took him photos and videos.When we realised, he could speak a little Italian, I helped and guided him to theChannel Tunnel using my phone. By the time we arrived, the ferry we weresupposed to board had left, and we waited almost 2 hours to get the firstavailable. He was exhausted and slept a bit before boarding and continuing ourjourney but before, we had the chance to chat a little. He admitted he didnâtknow the route and he was replacing one of his colleagues. He said he is fromMarocco and has 14 yearsâ experience driving bus but he never faced a situationlike that. He gave me his mobile number.I had to guided him again to reach the final stop; we reach Victoria Coach Stationat 9.35 pm. The arrival was scheduled for 5.30 pm. We missed our flights toSpain and we had to stay in hotel for that night. Therefore, we ask to be refundedfor all the extra money we had to spend for your incompetence.All the receipts and tickets are enclosed to this letter.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Although it is cheaper to go with Flixbus than with other bus companies, service is important. Unauthorized driver who threatens bus passengers by putting on the seat belts in case of an accident happens "You must give your life but near your narrow bodies (pointing out a person) becomes heavy like elephants and mosses around then is the life of other people as get involved ". "Do not you believe me?" he says to this person, "check on youtube", my first experience with flixbus and it was not nice. Having no problems with drivers are straightforward and clear with rules but when they swear and are unpleasantly threatening, it affects the entire review. Will not choose the flix bus when I travel with luggage in worry that I can not bring along. Weared a backpack with computer and valuable things and outside a camera in a camera bag. But it would not follow if I could not get it in my backpack or if it did not go in my luggage which I think is not sure enough. When I had put it down in my backpack, he questioned the weight in the backpack, pointing out that it was seven kilos, and that it had to fit in the upper shelves and not under the seat. When I got into the bus I can count the bags on a hand lying on the shelves. The bus only has no passengers. Unnecessary aggressive treatment.', 'stars': '1'}

Has advertised to the bank and had to block the card. Indeed, there is a suspicion that Flixbus is aware of not responding if you are to evaluate other reviews from Trustpilot. It's so bad business management that it's going to spit. He's been driving with Flixbus before and they're quite happy to travel, so there's nothing to fault there. But, it's a coward that they buy up all of the local and regional bus companies, so you get the same service, but risk getting money.

{'review': "As a musician flixbus is not an option. They only allow you to take instruments such as guitars, violins and violas in the luggage trunk. Instrument insurance policies do not cover this, and the risk of irrectifiable damage to your instrument is huge. Most musicians that were ever on tour know that violins fit in overhead compartments, between your legs or when there is space; on the floor of the seat next to you. Flixbus employees are many times fine to let you board with a violin. But sometimes there's that one employee that denies you boarding and refuses to let you show that it fits in the overhead. If you're on your way to something important that day they say no, you're screwed. Don't risk it, take the train or another company instead.", 'stars': '1'}

One of them ACTUALY raised his shoulders to say he didn't know. So, one driver doesn't know that he is NOT in Vienna but in another city. The other driver said that we were in Vienna. Actually allowed to take my bags leaving me stranded to find my own way to Budapest. I expected the drivers to be able to guide me. I could  never reach Flixbus by phone. I received a rude reply via messenger but still a link to file a claim to which I receive irrelevant automatically generated messages. Highly disappointed. I am STILL trying to file this claim from Vienna to Budapest and to lodge a formal complaint against both drivers. Without a doubt.

{'review': 'So, I have been a loyal customer for the past weeks while traveling in Europe with Flixbus. Unfortunately, I have lived a very disappointing event and I would like to share it with you so you can take your mesures next time you think of traveling with this company.Last Wednesday, August 23rd 2017, I booked a trip from Brussels to Maastricht at 4:35pm (booking number: #8045960869). I have arrived at the train station in Brussels where the Flixbus buses park at 4:20pm. While waiting for the bus (and none of them had a sign with Maastricht or KrakÃ³w), I went and asked a man with the Flixbus uniform about the arrival of the train. He searched all of the buses in the terminal and asked one chauffeur about it and they both said it was late and on it\'s way (because at that time many of the buses were late because of traffic). So we stayed there and waited more. At that moment, the Flixbus agent was gone and no one was there to give assistance to all the people waiting for their late buses and we all found this very unsatisfying. Reaching 5pm, because no one was there to help us, I decided to call the customer service by phone and have more information about the late bus. The lady who spoke to me on the phone took my booking number and my personal information and told me the bus was still on it\'s way and it should take around 10 min for him to arrive. After 20 min, no sign of that bus. So I called again. Now, this agent on the phone told me that the bus was never late and it was there on time and left at 4:35pm. At that point, we were all shocked by this assistance from the agents on the phone and in place. Everyone said that the bus was on it\'s way and we could not know in any way that it was on time because the Flixbus agent on place went and searched and asked and said the bus is not here. I explained this situation to the lady on the phone and, after 20min of explaining our frustration from me and other passengers in the same situation, she offered me a 12euros voucher (code: CUS8PFACC\u200b given at 5:57pm) to use to buy another ticket for the next bus at 9:05pm. This was the minimum she could offer me, but because of the stress and tiredness I was living I accepted to be able to get to my destination. Now, I asked her to book the ticket for me because I had no computer with me and she said it was going to be 3euros more. At this point, the service was getting worst. I refused and went to book it on my phone. Because all this wasn\'t enough, the voucher was not applicable on the Flixbus application (there was no place where we could apply it) and while booking the tickets it charged me the full amount! I loved traveling with your company but this was too much for me. Now the voucher is expired and I lost money. I then sent a complain to their customer service and the answer was:" Dear FlixBus customer, Thank you for your message.We can assure you that our time schedules are planned with great care to transport our customers comfortably and on time.We regret that this did not work out this time.However at times delays are caused by events which we, despite greatest care and preparation, cannot influence.If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding. We also hope to be able to convince you of the quality of our service in the near future again and to welcome you on board of one of our green buses soon.

No idea why they could not disclose this at the beginning, but you had 25 very angry people waiting on a polluted curb in a shady part of town with no news or way to contact the company. Turns out our trip had in fact been cancelled, because by the time they arrived it was the next scheduled time for the day. We tried calling the numbers listed on their website and Facebook page several times, but only got an automated recording in German, despite pressing the option for English. What's more, they say this number should be operated 24 hours so that is false advertising. I am completely appalled with this experience and their lack of care or attention when it came to a resolution. We had been traveling since 3am that morning and this experience most certainly put a damper on our short time in this German town.", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'Travelled from Munich to Prague - 20 minutes late upon departure (even though the bus was starting in Munich). After about an hour, the driver drove off the highway and stopped at a rest-station where we were supposed to wait for 10 minutes for another driver (no idea why?), which turned out to be 25 minutes. Then the bus drove into a traffic jam that was reported on GoogleMaps by the time we departed (and of course there was a possibility to go around) -> another 45 minutes delay.Information about the delay was only in German, the driver did NOT (nor even tried to) speak English.No apology for the 90 minutes delay.Plus the great free internet on board means that you get 150MB of data for a 4.5 hours (that turned out to be 6 hours) trip and then they cut you off.Plus no seat reservation causes a herd of people trying to board as soon as possible, so that they could sit together.

{'review': "So, me and my boyfriend were supposed to go on a vacation to Biograd na moru. I was leaving from Beograd at 1.50am and he was departuring from Ljubljana at about 5am. We were supposed to meet in Zagreb at 7.10am and then wait for our bus to Biograd at 9.30am. His bus was 3h late so we didn't make it to our bus in time. While I understand Flixbus can't control the traffic I don't understand why noone was there to help me. I was alone in Zagreb for 3h running and asking around what we were supposed to do, while my boyfriend was still on the bus to Zagreb. First i went to the Flixbus ticket office where a lady didn't even try to help me and just told me she doesn't know and looked at me as waiting for me to leave. Then finally, I got some help from a guy who pointed me to the Flixbus office as if they can help me there. The Flixbus office was closed with no signs where anyone was and where i can find anyone that can help me. Next i went to the information point where again i was just kindly asked to leave because the information point here doesnt cooperate with the Flixbus company. Then naturally i got tired of running around with my huge backpack so i went back to the place where Flixbus sells their tickets where now the guy who has helped me before, was selling the tickets and I told him that there is noone around to help me and that i desperatly need help. He was then kind enough to give me the number of the Flixbus information point where I was just told that i have to rebuy the tickets and then got hung up because of bad cell connection. So I called again and i got a man on the phone, wich actually tried to help me, until i was put on hold. Forever. The guy just disappeared for about half an hour until my boyfriend finally came and i just hung up because there was noone on the phone anyways. We then got everything sorted out when we found the emplyee working at Flixbus with the green shirt and he was very kind and helped us rebook a new ticket, so everything was sorted out. Now, my vacation is over and i wan't to go home. And after alredy waiting 3h at the bus station, I get a message 3mins before the bus was supposed to be here that it is going to be late for 1h55mins. Now my problem with Flixbus now is:1st.: The organization. There is no organization what so ever. I dont understand why the people working at Flixbus aren't more connected. I dont understand how I, was left walking around the bus station for 3h asking for help and noone could call anyone and ask what was going on.2nd.: Timing. If you download the Flixbus app it strickly tells you, you have to be at the bus station on time, or actually even 20min before the bus arrives. So what I expect from them that if the bus is going to be late, it is not said 3mins before the bus was supposed to be here, but at least 20mins before. So my experience with the Flixbus was that eventhough the bus itself is ok and has all the things it offeres, the buses are late and noone really helps you unless you're lucky enough to spot on of the employees in the green shirts.", 'stars': '1'}

My story is that via their app I bought a ticket from Odense Syd / Dalum to Randers on 14.08. When I get up to take the bus a few days later, a sign hangs that says the bus stop has been moved to the other end of the city a few days before. On my ticket in the app, there is still a departure from Dalum. After two calls to their customer service (for they did not send the voucher promised at the first call), they maintain that it is my own mistake as it is mentioned on their website and in a ticket I received by mail. The problem is that I have used the app exclusively and there are other information in it. So I was an hour late on my trip and had to buy a relatively expensive train ticket in addition to the money I had put out for the bus ticket. Flixbus will not refund my money and if I need a voucher on the amount, I will pay 10 kr. Fee. They did not even regret the bad information. The trip with Flixbus canceled myself (for a charge of 10 Kr. Of course) and drove with Sortbill instead.

In the end, we actually arrived even later than the driver\'s prediction, it was "just" 10 more minutes, but considering that the delay was nearly as long as the trip itself, I don\'t understand how can a company work under these conditions.I would not recommend the service unless you value money more than your time, some of the unlucky passengers whom had booked flights were in quite a bind, because honestly, it\'s quite inconvenient to make plans under the assumption that your bus *could* arrive 2-3 hours late!', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'I wrote it to the FlixBus 2 weeks ago: I bought tickets to my sister on your homepage from Florence to Budapest. She start her journey in Florence at 30th of July, but because of technical problems the bus stopped at 04:00 (31th of July) on the highway. So she was call me and I was call you to ask about the next steps I got the information you send an other bus and she can travel with the next bus from Ljubljana.The new bus arrived to the highway around 9 o\'clock and to Ljubljana at 10:30. Bus driver told all of the people have to came back at 14:45 who go Vienna or Budapest. My sister go back in time but the bus driver told her and an other passenger that they are not on the list, so my sister ask them to call the company what happen but the driver refused this and was shouting that ,,go to the hell" or he call police... As I know the driver was very unpolite with all the passangers and also aggressive with my sister.After this we called your company and she got a ticket for 1th of August. After a short late the bus arrived at 01:30. This bus went to Vienna not directly to Budapest, so after an other change and an other late the bus arrived to Budapest around 11:30 (1th of August).It isn\'t normal to arrive from Florence to Budapest on the third day from the start of the journey. The bus driver\'s behavior is not acceptable at all and I think I will write a review to your Facebook page not because of the many late but this impolite and aggressive staff. I read the bus passengers rights in the EU and also the national law and the minimum rights are these:If your long-distance journey (more than 250km) was scheduled to last more than 3 hours and departure is delayed by more than 90 minutes or cancelled, you are also entitled to:- Either you can get a refund for your ticket and where necessary free journey back to the service\'s initial departure point - you can later complain and claim a refund for the ticket plus compensation worth 50% of the ticket price.- meals and refreshments - proportionate to the waiting time or delay- accommodation if you have to stay overnightIt was a horrible travel full with wrong informations and services from your company and unacceptable behavior from the staff, so we expect the compensation from the ticket price and also a compensation because of the missing services like meals and refreshments.After 2 weeks they answered 1/3 of my questions:,,We can assure you that our time schedules are planned with great care to transport our customers comfortably and on time.We regret that this did not work out this time.However at times delays are caused by events which we, despite greatest care and preparation, cannot influence.If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride."So they not really care that my sister arrived on the 3. day after this (normally) short way, they even don\'t care about my other questions about the food and drink what they have to give in this situation or the fact that they gave totally wrong information about the new bus in the phone.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'We have been customers of Flixbus for quite a long time.This time we decided to travel from the Flixbus stop situated nearby the Hague Central Station to Munich (line 268 at 18.00, 28 July 2017 ).The trip began later than we expected because the bus was late for an hour and we had not been duly informed about that in advance. Despite this fact, we were pretty confident that there would be enough time for a transfer to another bus in Monchengladbach which was going directly to Munich.To the contrary,I would say that the driverâs actions were professional, notwithstanding the fact he had another trip earlier this day, as well as he was alone during this trip, that, to the best of my knowledge, are not in line with the companyâs policy and principles which provide that there should be two drivers in the bus.It is worth mentioning, that we were not the only persons who were supposed to have transfers in different cities, some other people were in the same position.With regard to the timing, I would like to underline, that our transfer was scheduled for 00.12 am, 29 July 2017, at the Flixbus stop in Monchengladbach.Unfortunately, on our way to Monchengladbach the bus suddenly broke down. It happened in Roermond (the Netherlands) at around 11.20 pm (the electricity was fallen for unknown reason).\xa0 Therefore, we contacted the Flixbus customer service in order to find any solution. The company reassured us that they would do their best to provide relevant assistance. Regretabbly, the bus was fixed only 2 hours after, but the customer service did not respond to our numerous calls.\xa0We arrived to Monchengladbach at around 03.00 am and made another attempt to reach the customer service by phone, to no avail. It is noteworthy, that there were neither hotels nor taxi nearby the Flixbus stop. Since there was no possibility to get to Munich by other transport, except by train or taxi, both are very expensive means of transport, we had no choice, but started to search the hotels to stay for that night.In the morning of 29 July, after having almost sleepless night, we finally reached the representative of the customer service by phone who was surprised by what happened last night. She therefore proposed us to use the voucher of the company to travel to Munich via Bremen in the evening of the same day. We thanked her for this kind proposal, but stated that it was too late to make it, since we wanted to spend full weekend in Munich. At the same time, we agreed to use the voucher to accomplish the trip to Paris (our final destination which we were supposed to reach right after spending two days in Munich).\xa0In this regard, I would like express my strong dissatisfaction with the level of work of the Flixbus company customer service that caused moral damage to me and my husband, as well as additional expenses, namely the reservation of the hotel room in Monchengladbach, cancellation of tourist trips/around Munich, expenses related to the car rental.Maryna & Anatolii', 'stars': '1'}

They refuse to refund me, even though I couldn't get to my destination in a timely manner and didn't even end up using them due to the EIGHT HOUR delay. They ask you to pay for your own accommodation after stranding you in a foreign city and you have to pray to God they'll refund that, but good luck.

{'review': 'AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Booked this coach on a return from London to Brussels. The journey going the coach was on time but the drivers could not have been any ruder if they tried. After having to load all the luggage into the back of the coach ourselves, I then kindly asked to sit downstairs with my young child who gets terrible travel sickness so that we could be nearer to the toilet. The driver just blatantly refused claiming it was full all though it was more than half empty. Upon arrival in Brussels the drivers then thought it appropriate to throw people suitcase out of the back of the bus nearly hitting a few people. Unfortunately, the tragic tale does not end there for this dissmal coach company. On the return trip they sent out text messages saying the bus was delayed from 13:55 - 14:55, at 15:35 a representative was asked where the bus was and his response was "honestly we don\'t have a clue we have been told to keep saying 10 minutes". At 16:00 another text message was sent stating the bus was now 2:30 hours delayed and then another one at 16:15 saying the bus was 2:45 hours delayed. Thought this delayed process we had to wait outside with all our luggage waiting for this bus with no real information being shared. The bus which was meant to arrive back in London Victoria at 8:00 arrived back at 11:30pm! To then try and call Flix customer services is then another battle as the line says press "1" for english but it doesn\'t actually work and when you speak to any member of staff they hang up on you. I wanted to speak to them asking for my full refund but I cannot therefore I have to write a review in the hope that they see this. Knowing the lack of customer service and empathy that has been shown on this trip I wouldn\'t hold my breath. I would recommend Eurolines or any other company other than this one.Then I got this terrible reply from their customer services team "Dear FlixBus customer, Thank you for your message.We can assure you that our time schedules are planned with great care to transport our customers comfortably and on time.We regret that this did not work out this time.However at times delays are caused by events which we, despite greatest care and preparation, cannot influence.If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding. We also hope to be able to convince you of the quality of our service in the near future again and to welcome you on board of one of our green buses soon. Kind regards,".', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Traveled to Berlin from Copenhagen and returned in July 2017. At first I did not have to get on the bus because I\'m not on the passenger list - even though I\'m flagging with my ticket and my passport. The driver will not communicate with me and keep saying "momento". Finally, I insist and put myself in! During the whole trip, drivers / drivers will not communicate with me or many of the other passengers in either Nordic languages, English or German. They were shown Romans! When buying a ferry, we spend a very long time while one driver is in, and the other discusses loudly on the phone in a language that we Danish passengers did not understand. We are waiting in line at the ferry dock in Gedser, arriving, loading, loading - and then sailing and there are two hours for the next ferry. We will not be informed at all. It\'s only when I go down and tell the drivers what happens and require some information that one takes the microphone and says "Zwei Stunde Pause" !!! It turns out, we find ourselves (through the ticket office in Gedser) that there was no reserved space for the bus at the departure at. 11.00 - that is, the departure from Flixbus departure to Berlin with every single day. We therefore had to wait two hours extra - absolutely unacceptable on such a background. Some of the passengers were insecure due to the lack of information and the drivers\' lack of communication with us - an elderly lady unhappy, for she had to go by bus to Budapest from Berlin at. around 17.00 (we should arrive at 3.30pm in time). A mother with two children would continue from here at. 17.40 and was also worried. I called the Flixbus Danish department and came through after 20 minutes. Here I spoke to Jonas repeatedly. despite my repeated explanation, continued to insist that Flixbus could not take responsibility for ferry departures. I asked to talk to his boss, it took some time, Jonas came back and continued in the same groove. I told about our insecurity at the drivers and insisted on talking with his boss. Then Jonas made the pipe! We arrived in Berlin 2 1/2 hours later than planned. When I went home, there were also challenges. The bus came, everyone (many to a double-decker bus) got ready, a manager at the ZOB (bus station) from Flexbus came to look up at the front with a driver, and the doors were closed and we were told we should wait. We did so for half an hour. No information - we were 15 minutes late already, the drivers went frustrated around - and NO informed us what happened. We then found that the waiting time was due to a stone slash in the windscreen, and it had to be clarified, insurance, whether we had to drive. Suddenly, on the information sign on the bus, the bus is canceled. Again no INFO - everyone is wildly frustrated. The Flix Manager comes in after five minutes, and then we have to drive anyway. However, he says in German when I ask what has happened - that we have been allowed to drive but that "he would not do that". Not just something that calms passengers going on a 420 km. long drive. Traffic delays, the bus company can not be blamed for, but not having a seat reservation (and so during the busy holiday season) and did not want to communicate - neither in the bus nor in the bus. phone - it\'s for me to look completely unnecessary and unacceptable.

{'review': "Flixbus driver ASSAULTED me in the street after I asked for his name to file a complaint about his unprofessional behavior. This happened because I tried to help de-escalate a bad situation, caused by the horrific behavior of the Flixbus staff, which was endangering the safety of an infant child.The driver and other Flixbus staff verbally berated a customer in German for attempting to load a baby carriage into the bus prior to checking in. The customer, a father traveling with his wife and infant, didn't understand German and was reasonably offended at being treated so rudely. The situation escalated to an argument and the driver banned the entire family from riding the bus, even the mother and baby, in the middle of the night, in freezing weather. The father, reasonably, believed this outrageous treatment may be racist, as he and his family were from Africa. I tried to reason with everyone, get everyone to apologize, calm down, and get the family in the bus, since they'd done nothing wrong, especially not the wife and baby. The wife was pleading for the sake of her child, who was in real danger in -2 C, to let them on the bus. When I tried to help, the staff threatened to ban me from the bus as well. They looked like skinheads, by the way.When I got to my destination I asked the driver for his name to file a complaint. When he refused, I started taking video and asked again. Then he chased me out of the bus and attacked me in the street, grabbing me by the neck and pulling my hair.I filed a complaint with the local police.I informed Flixbus, and they blew off my complaint of ASSAULT and the horrible treatment of the family. They also refused to tell me the name of the driver who assaulted me to add to the police report.Regardless of any external circumstances, such an unstable, violent person is a dangerous bus driver. But Flixbus chose to continue to jeopardize the safety and lives of its customers rather than address their problem is staff selection and training.

{'review': "My one-day trip from Brussels to Cologne/ Bonn was a true fiasco because of the delay of the Flixbus buses.In the morning of 01/07, the bus to Cologne/ Bonn (airport) was late for one hour and a half (they notified me about the delay at 6.30, the moment when we were supposed to leave). In the evening, the same day, I was supposed to leave from Cologne/ Bonne (airport) at 21:05. Many people were waiting for the bus and only after one hour after the supposed departure time, Flixbus sent us a SMS saying that the bus will be late for 4 hours and 5 minutes (which in the end were almost 5h).At almost 11 PM there is no train that goes from Bonn to Brussels and no other transportation (except hitchhinking, probably). At 1 o'clock, a bus going to Oostende (via Brussels) parked in the parking area. The driver refused to take a few passengers going to Brussels because our tickets were not valid! I understand his comment, however, since the bus from the same company did not come, it would have been polite to give us an alternative and the option to finally travel to our destination.  Moreover, because drivers' English was limited, we could not communicate and find out why there was such a delay.In the end, after 5 hours of waiting, the bus to Brussels (and then Gent and London) arrived. Drivers did not even mention why caused such a delay and why we have not been informed before our departure about the 5h delay, so we could have potentially find a train to our destinations. I arrived to Brussels at 5 am. In order to avoid all the frustration they caused to me and many other passengers, I think that Flixbus should improve their communication system, train their drivers to answer questions and come up with solutions when such delays happen. They could potentially increase a bit more the prices of the tickets (as they are very cheap at this moment) in order to offer a better service and client support. Moreover, the technology available nowadays could be used to monitor such delays and inform passengers accordingly.", 'stars': '1'}

Drivers cannot change or cancel bookings for you.9.6 If a ticket for a trip is not used and in case that the carrier is according to 2.2 one of the FlixCompanies then the fare is reimbursed upon request along with the ticket, less a â¬15 processing fee per passenger and ride, insofar as the passenger cannot establish that no damages or damages for a lesser amount were incurred. The burden of proof for not using the ticket is on the passenger. They don't have costumerservice i Denmark and you call a number which you don't know in which country is. The costumer service is helpless and can't do anything for you. I will do everything to get my money back. When you have a website in Denmark, you must Follow the Danish legislation or close your company. Please don't use your money in this way. You can not trust them.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'So, I think this might be the WORST transport company I ever had to deal with - my story is like this:I booked a trip for Stockholm to Gothenburg and return for June 24-27th 2017.First - something happened with the site while paying for my tickets so I got double charged for the same trip. No matter how many times I called and how many mails I wrote - explaining it\'s a double payment made due to a site error, there was no way to get a refund for it. Once I got an email from the customer service confirming that they checked my case and I\'ll get a refund. But no money back. When I asked again what\'s going on - every time a different person form customer service answered there is no way to get my money back for the double payment - only cancel one booking and get the stupid voucher. Second - and the most stupid - 2 hours before my trip I got sms and mail from Flixbus stating that my "booked ride was cancelled with a short time of notice" and call some number for finding alternatives. 2 HOURS BEFORE!!!! Actually they couldn\'t find any alternatives because there was no other bus going to my direction that day. I had to deal with this by myself, with no refund and no other compensation.Again, when asking for a refund, they told me to write another email to customer service. Brief, till today no answer and no refund for a trip cancelled by Flixbus, only an this email "Delays mostly occur due to external factors, such as weather conditions, last minute changes of bus stops or congestion. We can therefore not be held responsible for such matters." So, they are not responsible for canceling a trip?? Who is then?? And how can I get my money back?Not to mention that they didn\'t bother to let me know the trip was cancelled both ways. They confirmed the return trip and only by calling them the day before I found out this was canceled too, no one from Flixbus bothered to let me know I actually payed for nothing.So, as long as I don\'t have any conversation partner, they take no responsibility for canceling bookings I payed for and I don\'t see any money back, I call this thievery. They just stole my money at this moment.Dear travelers, please stay away from Flixbus - don\'t put your money in it. You risk to pay for nothing other than calls to customer service for trips that are not happening. You risk your nerves and putting yourself in the situation of quickly finding a more expensive way to get to your destination.

{'review': 'I booked with Flixbus for an overnight service from Karlsruhe to Prague because it was the only direct bus on that day departing late enough for me to catch at the end of a business trip. Booking went smoothly, I got several confirmations by e-mail, the latest one at the morning of tdeparture. However, approximately two hours before the planned departure, I received an SMS informing me (with a very formal apology) that the bus was cancelled, that I have been transferred to an alternative route and that all additional information has been sent to me by e-mail. Since I do not own a smartphone, I had no way to access my e-mail, so I had to phone the non-stop service line of Flixbus. It took two attempts to be connected to a (very polite!) English-speaking assistant, and then some effort to persuade her that repeated sending of the e-mail wonÂ´t help me and that I really need at least the time of departure, service No and, most importantly, my individual code over the phone. Why couldnÂ´t they send this information in the original SMS??Moreover, itr turned out that the alternate route involves an almost two hours stopover at Frankfurt in the middle of the night (departure 00.15). The bus was late for both parts of the journey - approx. an hour for the first (there I at least got an SMS announcing a 40 min delay due to heavy traffic) and about half an hour for the second (no info from the company) .Both in Karlsruhe and in Frankfurt the boarding took place (and the travellers had to wait!) at a place that fell deep below the standards of a small town bus stop e.g. of the 1980ies Czechoslovakia , which at least usually had a shelter, something to sit on, and a public toilet, or at least some useable bushes  nearby. The toilet of the Karlsruhe bus station was out of service, and walking the 600m to the closet loo at the Frankfurt main station before midnight through a building site frequented by some shadowy figures was not a pleasant experience!. Green busses seemed to be coming at random times and stopping at random places, resulting in the crowd of passengers running around (with all luggage) to find out whether this happens to be their connection. I do not wish to imagine what would the place look like in continuous heavy rain!While the ride itself was OK, I would have been more than happy to pay more in exchange for a better service at stops. At least in Frankfurt it would perhaps be worth investing into an info-screen in the window of the Flixbus office at the bus stop to announce incoming buses.  I also frankly do not understand why FlixBus decided that people who are not all the time online deserve to be treated as second class citizens.', 'stars': '1'}

They seem to have completely forgotten that the people they transport are CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES! They sometimes try to make a few jokes at the beginning of the travel but good luck understanding it\'s only in German. This "sympathy" doesn\'t compensate their rudeness at all in my opinion. - Don\'t put any fragile items in you bag going in the lock it will be (every time) thrown literally on the floor and in/off the lock as a piece of garbage in the trash - and they\'re very likely to throw bags on top of yours. - I write this as we just went out for a 5min break and in the middle of the break someone was walking a bit too far for the driver\'s (or should I say Kommandant?!) taste. The driver went completely mad and shouted at him to come back (I guess, German again...) and cancelled the break for everyone shouting all passengers to get back on the bus. "no brain, no break" ("kein kopf" that\'s all I understood with my bad German level) - And last but not least...

I hope it helps prevent others from going through the same horrible experience that I went through with Flixbus.It all began on a Monday, when my wife and I missed our bus. The Paris Flixbus depot is just a make shift parking lot with no numbers, no announcements, the only thing around are a bunch of people aimlessly wandering around looking for their bus like a zombie apocalypse. Anyways, We miss the bus because we couldn't figure out where the bus was.  We go to the little temporary shed/booth that's 20 meters from the entrance and tell the attendant our situation. She tells us the only thing we can do is call customer service. We call customer service. They explain to us that there is nothing they can do with their system and that if we want to rebook we need to e-mail.We e-mail. We receive an e-mail back an hour later, in the fine print it states that it may take several days for them to review our e-mail. After reading that we called back and had to demand to speak to a manager and tell them that we needed to rebook for the next bus (which was the next day). The manager hooked us up with a voucher for 89.00 euro (our tickets were 120.00 euro, but thats fine). We get our ticket.THE NEXT DAY ON THE N100 TO BERLIN...June.5th Monday 2017 21:00.  We make sure this time to run around the parking lot checking every single bus that pulls in and out. Our bus gets in and about 50 people run up to it. There's no line up, no organization. Just the bus driver yelling at everyone in German. We it comes to our turn the bus driver screams at us about the painting we have with us (which is in cardboard) It was 24X30X2 inches. We didn't understand what he was screaming was that we weren't allowed to bring it with us. We offered to pay extra and he REFUSED that it comes with us. I observed a bicyles, a guitar case, and other odd thing but our painting wasn't allowed for some reason. After both my wife and I beg and pled we finally asked if the painting was removed from the frame if it could come (there was no glass btw, very simple wood frame). He kind of nodded his head. So we remove the frame. At this point every one is on the bus with their luggage. He looks at the canvas and scoffs saying it's still not good enough. He gets on the bus, now our luggage was on board too underneath everyone else so the driver didn't want to get our luggage. He was going to drive off with it. A woman handed us a knife and we had to cut out painting off the wood on its back and roll it up. My wife was crying as she watched me be forced to destroy our painting. (Her deceased family member painted it in the 1930's)Everyone was on the bus watching in horror, a few people asked the driver to just let us bring our painting. He didn't care. When we finally got to Berlin as people got off the bus they started to get their own luggage. The driver yelled some more and started LEGIT throwing peoples bags off the bus.

It got delayed by 7 hrs and I got a message about a free travel coupon by flixbus. Which I have not yet received. This is a different issue but more importantly please read what happened that night.I must say this was a nightmare journey for me and all other passengers. I would briefly tell what happened:1. The bus was at 9.05 pm in the night. First we got a message that bus will be delayed by one hr. That was fine. Then after an hour we got message that delayed by 3.hrs. Then after another 2 hrs we got message that delayed by 4hrs 40mts, then got message that delayed by 6hrs 40mts and then got message that delayed by 6 hrs 55mts. So everyone lost patience, children of passengers crying etc. Can a bus get delayed by 7 hrs? Shouldn't have a new bus been arranged in this time?2. There was no provision for passengers stay arranged during this delay time. It was our luck that the pickup point was airport, so we got in and could somehow manage this time. Think of it was in some remote place or think of someone who is getting in from a remote pick up point.3. Heater not working in bus. Though it is April, but still at night it was cold enough and we required heater, but it was not working. 4. Toilet out of order in bus. Imagine people waiting whole night for the bus and then the heater not working and on top of it toilets also out of order. We were not able to use toilets till 12 noon, till we reached the checkpoint. I had office urgent meetings and had a bad face in office. I Had to apply for leave.

{'review': "Worst journey I've ever had, considering it was my first ever coach trip. From the beginning the bus arrived two hours late to Victoria and before we even took off we were informed the toilet were not in operation considering it was a 12 hour journey. The driver didn't seem to know the way out of central London so we spent near to an hour going around in circles until a passenger took it upon themselves to direct him. When we finally got towards the channel tunnel, the driver adviced us all to take a 15 minutes break but he decided to disappear and take a break for up to an hour leaving us all standing outside the coach looking like idiots and this caused us to miss our crossing towards France.No apologies were given and the driver didn't appear to give a s***t quite frankly. When we finally got to France, the driver took so long to exit the ferry train that we were shut in which caused us to be even more delayed. Enroute in France the driver decided to divert down a country road and to our shock he decided to drop a passenger off in front of their house claiming the lady had kids. When passengers decided to confront him about the situation he got on the microphone and blamed us all for the situation even though there was no form of communication from him at all. Over four hours in France and when a passenger asked if we could stop at the nearest service station the driver replied and announced in an unprofessional manner that we can all get off and use the toilet and if we want we can sleep in the toilets as he's got all day to spend. It is now 21:02 and so far we've been on this 12 hours journey for over 10 hours and we're not even half way yet. The service today has been absolutely appalling and if I could rate it below a one star I would. Every passenger on the bus feels the same way and as we've been treated like we were on a free ride, I would like to request all my money back as the service we've received today has not amount to the payment we've all made for this journey. Because of this terrible service I and many other passengers have missed connecting flights, trains, coaches and important appointments.

Despite having been waiting at the place described in the e-mail sent before, it was passed through there and was not picked up, so we asked the customer center for support along with other passengers (14 people in addition to me) It was. Originally it was right that there was correspondence such as arranging other bus or repayment immediately. However, the customer center who called the first and second cases did not accept it at all and the third event finally got arranged to the bus at the next hour. At that point 3 hours passed since the original departure time. Moreover, I told that I was thru bused and could not get on, but I was 45 minutes late but I stopped at the station properly. Clearly later, it seems that it stopped and waited on the road one way ahead from where we should stop. I could not get on without noticing it and explained as if we have non-existence. And the next time the bus was arranged an additional 7 hours from there. Of course, the hotel in London that I had booked on that day was not cancelable at that time, so I wasted for one night, the station shop and the toilet closed for midnight departure, a fight between hunger and cold. I was worried that if I could not get on the next bus, I was waiting at the same position as before, and if I was waiting after I thought I was going to chase it, I was thrown through and it chased with a suitcase. I waited as usual at other stops, there is no announcement even though it is not a place to stop, no maps are corrected. It's really overly terrible. Although it was stated that there is wifi, power supply, in-flight sale, none of the buses I got wiped out. And the driver's correspondence is bad anyhow. I shouted at the customer in peace, and I kept waiting for seven hours but no apologies. I had expected but I did not get in touch with anything. In the 45 minutes I wait for the bus that was supposed to be on the first ride, it is told that I do not know anything when it is getting into another flixbus driver and I will not try to contact the company at all. Resentful against poor correspondence, some of the other guests cried, others were trembling with cold. There is no choice but to delay the bus. However, it is a company that does not work at all in response to something, care for customers. It was my first time traveling in Europe. Of course, I will never use it again, but if you are prepared to call for a long time by calling a customer center by myself, even if there is a delay or some trouble, I will use it for future use. I would like you to return one night's fee which has been wasted instead of full refund.", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "I arrived at the Victoria coach station at least 15 mins before my journey departure time 21:30 (13/05/17). CCTV footage would actually prove this. I had time to stop at the shop to buy sweets for my overnight journey to Amsterdam.When I arrived at the departure gate there was a crowd of people already there. The coach for Amsterdam was sitting there with the driver in his seat. I thought it strange that passengers were not boarding so I waited and waited. There was no last call, or indication that they were still boarding. Obviously the driver has a list of passengers with my name NOT ticked off. But no announcement. The coach was dark so I could not see any passengers on board. Then the coach left.If they were still boarding why was the driver sitting in the coach, doing nothing for that whole time I was waiting, with no one to indicate boarding? I have been calling Flixbus customer service in Germany and France all night until I was told to call and speak to a Manager in the morning. In the morning no Manager or Supervisor was willing to speak with me. They were very rude and simply insisted that their bus was on time. What is the point of being on time if your driver is sitting at the wheel? This incident can be proved by CCTV footage at the station but they don't seem to care... Everything they do in online, they have no physical representation at the Coach station. Maybe the driver was online as well?So here I am now still in London, when I should be in Amsterdam this morning. I had to book accommodation for the night. So I intend to take National Express tonight. They have a customer service that is accessible in UK and elsewhere.I finally continued my journey with Eurolines and felt much safer, comfortable and reassured. Especially since they have physical representatives in place throughout most of Europe as well as speedy online and phone response.

{'review': "Let me start this review by pointing out that Flixbus advertise themselves during the winter months as an easy and cheap way to get to the Alps or other skiing/snowboarding destinations. I can unequivocally say that if you plan to do this, and also plan to bring your own skis/snowboards, you're fresh out of luck. While it is true that Flixbus have provisions for taking oversized luggage (at a cost of 9 EUR per item), you are not guaranteed to be able to put this luggage on the bus. The real problem lies in the fact that passengers are only able to find out if they can take their oversized luggage or not 48 hours before departure, at the EARLIEST. Imagine our surprise when we called Flixbus (as is the procedure), the day before we were due to leave, only to find out that due to the fact it was a double decker bus, we would be unable to bring our snowboarding equipment.This then set in motion a sequence of communications between myself and Flixbus in order for me to get a refund for the trip, which all told took over 2 months. Flixbus' customer service agents were mostly agreeable and polite, although some were flat out rude. And despite trying on multiple occasions I never managed to get a supervisor on the phone. The way in which Flixbus handled my case for refund was unacceptable. I was forced to chase up my case on multiple occasions, as it is impossible to get the finance department on the phone. The case was dragged out by the fact that Flixbus only refunded me half the trip after I was explicitly told I would get the whole trip refunded. This then forced me to go through the whole process again, which took even longer the second time. In the end they refunded me the whole trip, but as it was two different cases one after the other, they charged me the service fee twice, which I find absolutely ridiculous. To sum up, Flixbus has terrible customer service (politeness aside), and ridiculous terms and conditions. If their goal is to lose customers, they have certainly succeeded.

She said it was impossible for her to say and that there\'s no use that we keep talking about it and then she hung up on me. I froze for 1 hour before the bus came.The bus itself did not have comfortable seats. The seats are actually less comfortable than those of the normal city buses in Lund, but they do recline. There was no space for me to put my carry-on luggage as I was sitting in the front and there were other stuff above me, so my carry-on had to go with the other luggage under the bus.The bus toilet was out of toilet paper and the driver informed us that there was no way for him to refill it until we would have a break after 4 more hours.As you can imagine, I\'m never again using Flixbus and I\'m telling all my friends to avoid this company.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "We have bought two tickets go and come back from Paris to Innsbruck. Main aim of the trip was skiing. On official website it is written that we can take bulky luggage, just need to call not earlier that 48 hours in advance. So, 48 hours in advance i call them and they say  - NO, you can not take your snowboard, there is no place. - Ok, then what solution you can propose? - To exchange the date of the tickets! - But we have already accommodation booked and paid! Ok, may be one of us exchange the date of ticket, but be able to take ski equipment. - You have to pay 25 euros extra for exchange because of difference in price. - Ok...Then i asked how do we do to return. And answer was - NO WAY! Because they have only double-decker buses that can not at all take ski equipment!We were very angry that woman in call center did not tell us this before. She knew, but didn't tell! So, we can not take ski equipment at all in Flixbus, there is no way, we pay extra to travel separately and it was absolutely useless. Than we wanted to come back just to initial booking to travel, ok, without equipment, but at least together. And.. we had to pay 20 euros more for this!!!Finally, we took the bus, bus itself is ok, not bad, with wifi and toilet. Drivers are brutal, area to wait the bus is outside (in cold) and there is no indication at all. The only good thing about this company - tickets are cheap (if you buy in advance).", 'stars': '1'}

At that moment, a violent fight broke out between the drivers, exchanges of blows took place and two drivers fell to the ground, one hit his head against the ground. The state of stress, shock and the important mark on the skull of one of the drivers did not prevent them from taking the wheel immediately after the end of the fight.

During a break, another passenger and I told the driver of our legitimate concern about the ability of drivers to drive after being hit on the head. The driver's response was surreal, he told us that if we had problems he would leave us at the side of the road ... To top it off, the toilets were unusable for at least half the trip.

{'review': 'Good afternoon I would like to share with you my personal experience with your company. We made a trip from Brussels to Amsterdam, my two friends and I, we traveled from Madrid in principle on a flight to Brussels. (Where I have not put any problem at all) The surprise is that when I get back from Amsterdam and take the bus the driver asks me for my documentation and I gave him my NiE, he tells me that he is invalid that he needs my passport. It must be that he does not know that to travel to the EU specifically the Schengen area is exempt from carrying a passport for residents and nationals of that space, it is sufficient to present the Nie, at the airport at no time they asked me for a passport. Conclusion, does not let us get on the bus saying that nothing that we can not and point, that the driver does not think we carry, in a bad way when we were in shock. I tried to explain to him that one day we came with this same company and the driver did not put problems but nothing ... finally we had to pay for a train and it took more than 4 hours to arrive.

{'review': "My friend and I missed our original bus due to a change in the pickup location which wasn't pointed out very well on the ticket. We had shown up at the original pickup location (asked staff around if we were in the right spot) and no bus showed up. Our ticket had two portions as there was a small layover in a town. We decided to take a train to catch up to the next stop to reconnect with our bus. The train set us back 100 EURO! We showed up at the next stop. The bus was 15-20min late and then the bus driver would not let us board. We had a ticket for the first portion and second. However, their check in system would not allow the driver to check us in on his phone even though we could clearly see our names on his phone. We spoke with him and he laughed and did not allow us to board. We needed to get to our final location so had to pay 59 EURO to board a bus we had already paid for. I have spent 3 months now emailing (back in my home country now) Flixbus with only an offer to provide credit towards a new trip. I don't think I want to ever ride with them again. I want the Money back that was wrongfully taken from me as I already had a valid ticket for the journey. On top of that both the customer service agents and bus driver were very rude through the process and they just don't seem to care. The day that was meant to be fun and only cost us 45 Euro turned into a terrible experience and set us back the original cost plus 159 EURO. Could have flown to our destination for that!

I had been told that delays can occur with flixbus so I booked a ticket where I was schedualed to arrive 4:30 hours before my flight - that would give me some extra hours incase of delays. I had to change bus in Karlsruhe and on my first bus I received to text messages from flixbus where they stated that they were 1 hour delayed. Fair enough I thought.

{'review': 'Earlier this week I had a harrowing experience with one of your drivers at the Paris, Porte Maillot Station, Route 802 direction Amsterdam Sloterdijk, 2:30 PM departure. I had booked a round trip ticket from Ghent Belgium to Paris from Friday to Sunday and had a very positive first experience riding with Flix Bus on my way to Paris, however today I experienced the most traumatic, embarrassing, and stressful travel experiences of my life because of your driver\'s refusal to allow me on board. I currently live in Belgium, but am an American citizen. Last week I misplaced my passport while visiting a friend (which will be recovered later this week), however this caused me to travel to Paris this week without a passport. To be safe I registered my travel with the U.S. Embassies in France and Belgium, and called Flixbus to find out what their passport policy is. His justification, "My bus, my rules." I asked if at the very least, understanding his concerns about crossing the border, if I could ride the bus as far as Lille, where I could take a reduced fare back to Ghent, without having to pay the full price of a unplanned train ticket back to Belgium. He assured me that by stranding me in Paris, he was teaching me a lesson that I won\'t soon forget. I then spoke with the security at the bus station, explained the situation, showed my credentials, and they decided it was up to the driver\'s desecration whether or not to let me on board. As you can guess, he abruptly shut the door to the bus and very aggressively pulled out of the station, leaving me in an unfamiliar city and without any clear way to get home.I spoke with the Porte Maillot station agent who offered a half-hearted apology and a 5 euro voucher for the "inconvenience." She then suggested, "You\'re better off taking the train." So after suffering a panic attack I recovered enough to endure a harrowing two hours of wandering the streets of Paris and getting off at a series of wrong Metro stops, I eventually made it to Gare du Nord, where I had to pay 76 euro for a one way ticket from Paris to Brussels, and an additional 10 euro to connect from Brussels to Ghent. Essentially to make it home safely, I had to pay more than I did during my entire weekend in Paris, plus endure the stress and anxiety that comes with not knowing when or how I would make it back.So if you would like to be publicly shamed and humiliated and left without any clear way how to get home, this is the travel service for you!

It just made me mad that more.. I spend 160 euroes on a train since I got it right there.... So i emailed the customer service and they just sent me a generic email. I wrote on facebook and of course that's when they wantd to appologize but at the end still refered me the email. after reviewing everything they told me nothing that they could do and I do have to have my passport and on top of that they said my voucher was never valid to begin with and canceled my trip to Strasbourg. wow... I mean wow... they sent me a confirmation and booking number and everything and it turned out they had never charged me.... I am glad that had happened, otherwise I woundn't have found postbus.

{'review': 'I have been traveling with this company several times, I guess around six or eight. Only in one of those trips WiFi was actually working. Why do you advertise WiFi if it is in fact not functioning? I guess I should turn to customer protection authorities cause company is giving false information about their services. Secondly, three journeys were delayed, last one for 30 minutes. Thus I missed very important appointment. I am perfectly aware that there are traffic jams etc, but then you must warn travelers that bus departure/arrival times are only indicative and not reliable. This is another reason to complain to customer protection authorities. Indicate realistic arrival and departure times. Moreover, why all the journeys are planned through the middle of major cities which will almost always lead to delays because of traffic jams? Remember that the traffic jams cannot be claimed as force majeure because you can reasonably predict these circumstances and avoid them by re-planing your routes which leads to that customers can ask refund for every delay unless there is a hurricane or circumstances like this. Unreachable customer service is another story. When you call, you "hang" on the line for more than ten minutes and then you just let go and stop trying to call. Each such call costs a lot of money. Who is going to refund me that? And I really needed to contact customer service because I must book my foldable bicycle. However, nobody picked up the phone and nobody replied to my already two emails so I do not know can I or can I not take my bike with me. It is also not possible to book the bicycle when purchasing tickets because system says that there are no slots for bicycle transportation, please contact our customer service and blah blah. Do you have like three employees there? It is indeed the last time I will use this company and will certainly not recommend it to anyone else, actually quite opposite.', 'stars': '1'}

We arrived at midnight, and we had anorther connection with another company to catch from Hamburg the next efternoon. So we talked to a guy in the Flixbus information at MÃ¼nich bus station, but he was like... I can\'t do anything, take another line next day and spend your night at a hostel! But we still had this connection from Hamburg that seemed to be impossible to reach. So no matter what, we just "lost" 2 tickets for a amount of 45 EURO.We asked him if Flixbus was going to pay for our expenses for the hostel and if they were willing to pay for some food?We did almost not have a break to eat during the 12 hour long bus trip. Especially the last few hours! But he was not willing to help, so we called the costumer service. The guy in the phone told us, that we could take a train, and the Flixbus would pay some of the expenses and refund the missing trip from Munich to Hamburg. "All" we had to do was to sent a traditionel letter with all the original tickets, and explaine our experience to Flixbus costumer service passengers rights. so we DID!

Our bus arrived with a delay of 2 hs and the driver said that the bus would stop in Dusseldorf and could not go to Dortmund.It took some time until my wife and I understood that, because we needed help of other people who spoke English and German to translate what the driver said (the driver didn't speak English). We don't know yet what happened, and why we couldn't reach Dortmund with the service.So, we were left in Dusseldorf near 1 am, and needed to arrive in Dortmund before 3 am. No one from Flixbus could help us, no English speaker.  We needed to call a friend to contact the customer service and get some help, since we were also not able to call them by ourselves.They suggested us to take a train between Dusseldorf-Dortmund, but it was not possible because it would arrive in time for our connection in Dortmund. This way, a guy from the costumer service that told us to pay a taxi and go to Dortmund, and that they would refund us with the value.  We took the taxi and spent 162 euros with that. We sent the receipts and information to the company by email and we had no answers (just the automatic ones). We called the customer service twice and they gave us template answers that our case will be analyzed and we should wait.There were almost 3 weeks since we did this terrible travel and we were not refund yet.

{'review': "We purchased 2 tickets for 1/7/2016 for the London-Amsterdam Flixbus service for an urgent family matter, with a changeover in Brussels. 15 minutes before the planned 10am departure from London Victoria Coach Station, we received a text informing us about a 4.5 hour delay (!). Fearing that we will miss the connecting bus at Brussels and get stuck in the city overnight, I clicked on the link in the message to write an email cancelling the tickets and claiming a refund (an option in the message with the corresponding email link). Also, I purchased 2 tickets for the 11am service to Amsterdam (changeover in Antwerp, scheduled to arrive at 22:40) and boarded this bus. This was just the beginning of a nightmare journey.While waiting in the queue for the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, our driver informed us that that there is an expected delay of 3-4 hours due to a problem in the tunnel. While navigating with the bus in the queue, we had a minor accident with an adjacent car, which our bus driver ignored and drove off... It took 4 hours to cross the Channel indeed, but our driver ensured everyone that at the first stop in Europe he will announce contingency plans for those who were about to miss their connecting buses due to the delay. It never happened, and after we went passed our first scheduled stop in De Panne, I asked the driver in Brugge about the arrangements for the passengers who already missed their connecting bus in Antwerp and his promised announcement, that never happened. He nonchalantly told me that we should phone the customer service ourselves!!! In panic, I did so and explained the situation. The German operator (if you choose English, you are doomed: you get connected to an operator repeating the words 'refund or voucher' without even trying to understand the situation...) finally understood the nature of the trouble, and he called me back in 50 mins with the news that they've arranged a connecting bus at 22:00 from Brussels to Amsterdam that we'll catch. So we did, and finally got to Amsterdam just after midnight, which meant instead of public transport we had to take a taxi to our accomodation. We both were a distressed bag of nerves by then.You would believe that it's impossible to trump as a bad travel experience, but the return trip on the 4/7/2016 from Amsterdam to London (changeover in Antwerp, scheduled arrival: 17:45) added a new factor: the fear of death. Another non-communicating German driver decided to take a ferry (!) across the channel this time, a decision he made himself as I accidentally overheard him on the phone. He forgot to communicate this to the passengers, despite the fact it straightaway meant a 3-hour delay at the minimum compared to the Eurotunnel route.We were hours late arriving to London at night, when the top of our bus hit a height restricting barrier driving into a tunnel! And our driver didn't seem to care, he drove on into the tunnel as if nothing had happened!! We were literally fearing for our lives as the driver drove between the two tracks, trying to avoid crashing the top of the bus in the wall of the tunnel on either side. The driver then lost the plot completely: first he drove straight into the City of London, making a tricky U-turn after coming to a corner the bus could not manage. Then he got lost again right next to Victoria Coach Station, where he drove us to Brompton Road to make another road-blocking U-turn at the Victoria & Albert Museum. From this point a fellow passenger was helping the bus driver out with his phone and Google Maps to find the destination... Finally we arrived at Victoria Coach Station, and could only laugh when we had to drive out again to go to the international arrivals instead a block away. Almost 5 hours late, after another nerve-wrecking travel experience topped with a fear of death, we finally disembarked at 22:15.Despite several complaints through mail and phone, to this day we still haven't received a formal apology nor a refund from Flixbus for the cancelled trip. The elusive customer service line is total shambles, in three attempts asking for the refund I received the following replies on the phone, in chronological order:1. it will be transferred in 5 working days (didn't happen)2. I didn't claim a refund at all, they haven't registered anything3. and lastly, it will be transferred in 4-6 weeks(!!!)", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "On the 29th of June I had booked the 5:45am bus with Flixbus from Dresden Central to Berlin SXF airport, which was to arrive at the airport at 7:50am.I was waiting at the bus stop from 5:20am. This 5:45am bus never arrived. After 6 am one guy telelephoned Flixbus as there were a few of us waiting for this bus and we were all getting anxious as we had flights to catch, he was told it would be another 10 minutes.  At 6:30am the 6:15am bus arrived 15 minutes late and it took all of us that we're waiting. Once on the bus we had no internet service at all.Unfortunately for those of us that had been waiting for the 5:45am bus we didn't arrive at Berlin SXF until 9:10am.For myself and others the boarding gate had closed. I had missed my flight and my connecting flight in Paris and any chance of getting home that afternoon. So after an overnight train journey and a full next day on a train and 350euro out of pocket I finally arrived home the next day at 5pm.When I arrived home I sent a complaint about the fact the bus never turned up nor had I been notified it wasn't coming plus the fact that I had paid 19 euro for the 5:45am bus and the 6:15 bus had only been 12 euro when I had booked it. The reply back was I should of allowed more time for my flight and to send my booking number so they could inform me as to why I hadn't been notified of the delay. I have had no reply and have since sent another complaint but have had no response. If the bus had of arrived on time and we had of been delayed on route to Berlin due to traffic problems or an accident , then I could understand. But for the bus to not turn up at all and no notification to anyone that there would be a delay ...to me that is totally unacceptable and disgusting. IT WAS A BUS GOING TO AN AIRPORT of course people have flights to catch.Reply to FlixbusThanks for your reply Flixbus. I did give my phone number but it appears it didn't go through. I had 3 trips booked with your company in that week I gave my number with each booking, the ph number came through on the other two bookings but doesn't appear on this one. Seeing as your buses travel such long distances and you offer bus services to airports. Maybe it could be bought to customers attention when making a booking that these buses can run up to 11/2 to 2hrs late due to the distance they have to travel and the possibility of traffic delays and driver rest breaks. As when I booked your bus the web site gave 3 departure time options 3.20am 5:45am  6:15am that morning of three buses arriving Berlin SXF from Dresden that morning all with an arrival time before 9am and in actual fact due to traffic delays etc that you are claiming? Supposedly only the early bus at 3.20am would of made it before 9am. Had I been made aware of this fact prior to booking I could of booked the earlier bus. There were a few distressed people waiting for that bus on the 29th and a few people did miss their flight. When the booking is made it doesn't mention where the bus is coming from and that it could have long delays. In all fairness to your customers this should be clearly stated.", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "I booked a return from from Eindhoven to Bruges with Flixbus, thinking that it would be more convenient and less stressful than driving. However, that was a mistake. A few things to be aware of if you're considering booking Flixbus:1) The bus can run extremely late, and they won't inform you of it accurately. From Eindhoven to Bruges, the bus arrived 30 minutes late, and on the way back, the bus arrived an hour late. In the end, along with a 45 minute 'break' at a remote gas station despite the fact that we were running extremely late already, I arrived in Eindhoven 2 hours later than the time given by Flixbus.2) Nothing works. The toilet wasn't working, and the wifi that they advertise  for all trips is a false claim because it apparently doesn't work outside of Germany. 3) Extremely unfriendly staff. The bus driver snapped at passengers who asked why we had to have a 45 minute stop at a remote gas station when the bus was already running 1.5 hours late. My guess is that it's a legal requirement, but it's only a guess because we were given no explanation about it. If the driver would taken the time to explain the reason for the stop, we would have all been in a better mood.In conclusion, whilst Flixbus is a great concept and appears to offer a convenient alternative to driving or trains, I would advise users to think twice before booking because he or she may be in a for a long and frustrating journey.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "I booked with Flixbus 2 rides. One from Venice to Ljubljana and the other from Ljubljana to Zagreb. The second one was an awful experience. The departure should have been in 4:30 in the morning. I waited until 5:30 and as I had not clue if it is just late or if it won't come at all, so I took a train at 6:20.I was waiting in the pouring rain with only 1 hour of sleep and was frustrated to find that their 24 7 service is not available. I contacted them trough Facebook and they responded while I was already in train for Zagreb and said to me that the bus was late 30 minutes. This was an obvious lie, so I got even more frustrated. There is one place where Flexibus gather in Ljubljana I was in front of it the whole time.So, the biggest problem was not that it was late but that they would not accept to give me a refund wich is in my opinion considerably small when comparing how frustrated I am now and that I will share my bad experience with this company with my friends and family. So, hopefully they will not do business with them as I did.They can be called Flexibus as I see that they are flexible with their timeline. So, please do not use this company if you are not flexible with yours.", 'stars': '1'}

It seems that Flixbus changes their journey to the next day. A default setting that seems strange when traveling short distances between MalmÃ¶ and Copenhagen.2. On the billiards and the website was the time for the bus at 19.10. At the sign at the bus stop in Copenhagen stood at 19.40 ??? What is right? 3. Does not matter because the bus never appeared! After an hour\'s wait, we decided to take the train instead.4. I wrote an email to Flixbussen the same day when we returned to MalmÃ¶. I did not want a "credit voucher" but the money back instead. They have not responded! Bad style, I think.', 'stars': '1'}

It seems that it does not pose a problem for them such a difference of destination..I do not recommend this company, and will never take these cars. This company is in addition to bad faith.

{'review': 'This was due to their careless managing of luggage and people.This was 5 months ago. At first I was awfully treated by their employees. Two of them actually told me Ã¯t\'s not my problem". After that was totally ignored no answers, nothing. Then, they made me come up with the receipts of the lost Items. For the receipts I could find (around 50% of what I had), they reduced the values almost by half, even though my stuff was 1year 4months old (they applied a ridiculous 3-year depreciation). Now all they say they will pay (around 1/4 of what they owe me) out of "good-will"I have no words to describe all that Flixbus made me go through, and how much frustration I had to endure so far. PLEASE don\'t support this company, do not travel with them!One more thing, I just met another person who is going through the exact same thing, it seems to be their operating procedure.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I traveled with Flixbus from Amsterdam to London, and had a terrible journey with them. I then proceeded to call them and was told to send an email to Forderungs Management. I did that but it has been more than 2 weeks and I still have not received any reply. I therefore decided to leave a review, by copy and pasting my complaint email below, which described my terrible experience in detail."Dear Forderungs Management,I am writing to you to request a refund for my trip from Brussels-North Station to London Victoria Coach Station on May 3rd 2016.I am sure I am not the only one who has sent an email regarding this specific journey, because it was a very frustrating journey.Below I will give you the account of what happened.Bus N84 arrived one hour late at Brussels North Station. We were scheduled to depart at 2.20am, but we ended up departing only at 3.30am. During this one hour, passengers were forced to wait outside in the pouring rain with not much shelter in the middle of the night. We were not at all informed of the delay, and were left wondering whether the bus was coming at all. We did not receive any text messages to inform us of the delay. When the bus finally arrived, the drivers had no communication with the passengers about what caused their delay, and there was no apology.At the French border, we were delayed by at least another hour. There was a couple on the bus who had their dog with them and apparently that caused them a huge problem. We don\'t know the exact details of this incident because the drivers again, did not communicate with us on what was happening. Again, we were left in the dark, forever waiting for the bus to move. When we finally moved a few meters and arrived at the UK Border Control, the same couple ran into trouble again because of their dog, causing us another 1 hour and 30 minutes delay. We were scheduled to take the eurotunnel at 6:50 am, but because of the delay, we only took it at 9:20 am. I also need to remind you that on my ticket, it said that the arrival time is 8:15 am in London, so the equivalent of 9:15 am Brussels time. At 9:15 am, we were still in the bus in France. We were also during this whole time, were not let out of the bus, and so we could not get any breakfast to eat. The last meal I had was dinner the previous day, on the 2nd of May.We finally arrived in London at around 11 am (UK time), but only to be at the wrong side of the station because the drivers failed to understand that departure and arrivals were not at the same place. Moreover, when a staff of the London Victoria Coach Station asked the driver whether he is arriving or departing, he said "Departure". I was coincidentally near the driver, so I then proceeded to shout out the window at the staff to tell him that we are actually just arriving, and that we are 3 hours delayed. The drivers were laughing at the fact that we were delayed by 3 hours.My partner and I had another connection bus to catch at Victoria Coach Station that was departing at 11am. We missed it, because we were still in the bus as the drivers navigate themselves to the correct arrivals area of the station. The communication between the bus drivers and the staff that was assisting in giving directions, was comical. The drivers\' English proficiency was very poor, and the staff member was forced to use very simple baby English. When we finally were allowed to leave the bus, it was clear that my partner and I have missed our connection bus. We were then forced to buy another ticket, which was more expensive that the initial tickets we had.Due to this massive delay, we were also forced to cancel all our meetings for that day and this has caused us much inconvenience. Due to this, we then had to reschedule our entire week, which proved to be very difficult and problematic. I am therefore asking for a full refund for this trip. The pain we went through was unacceptable."I hope that the management will finally take action and reply to my email.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I am a South African citizen with my first language being Afrikaans. However as I travel and know most people can\'t speak my mother toung I fall back on English to communicate. Traveling in France has not been easy trying to communicate but so far the people I delt with have been very accommodating.However this bus driver has extremely rude.I arrived at the bus stop early with about 4 other people and he made us wait outside. I then approached him asking if there is any shops where I can buy food as I am pregnant and need to eat frequantly. I left my hotel early morning without food thinking there will be a shop at the terminal. He then ask me to say what I said in French. I told him unfortunately I can not speak French and He just mubled somthing and waved his hand at me to leave. I again asked so there is no place to buy food and he started raising his voice saying things in French and told me NO FOOD! No SHOP! Wait till Paris!!! NO FOOD!!He then politely looked at the rest of the people and told them in French to board the bus. I stood in line but he them looked at me skipped me and went around me and helped the men (French) behind me and only lastly mumbled something in French and helped me last. After that he continued to be rude to me where I said nothing. All I asked "in English" was where I could buy food. This man was not only rude and disrepectful to a pregnant woman. He  was a racist agains the "English"I would suggest if you do chose their services rather not speak!', 'stars': '1'}

The bus was supposed to leave at 8.45 am and I got a text message saying that the bus was delayed 1 hour and 45 minutes. So instead of leaving at 8.45 am it would leave at 10.30 am. I was standing at the bus stop at 10.05, waiting to board the bus. At 11.00 am there was still no bus in sight, so I called the company. They could tell me that the bus was already on its way to Hamburg. It had left the bus station at 10.00 am. 30 minutes to early!!!!! Now I naturally got confused, sad, mad etc. and even more as I found out They didn't even want to give me a refund ticket to take the next bus 5 hours later! I am so furious with their service!

{'review': 'My trip from prague to dresden that should have only take 2 hours only, has become 7 hours due to the the bus drive compliance problem with the local driving regulation in prague. Some passengers were managed to take another transportation at that time.Most of the passengers has already known that this bus company never departed on time and always arrived late in the destination. It even got worst, since most of the driver\'s are only speak in german (and most of the german [that I met during the trip] are simply said "no english" to the foreigner), which makes it really hard to know what is the actual reason of delay of the trip, not to mention about the problem of hearing the name of the destination (since the voice is really low and not understandable due to the accent of the driver).', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "With five hours to kill in Munich's bus station, why not write a review. The gist is, if Flixbus worked seamlessly, without traffic jams, it's great. But in our case, it didn't. Here are some objective reasons why you should think twice about going with them. 1. Customer service kicks you out of their office at 12 midnight sharp.2. Locating their buses is confusing. There are no signboards whatsoever. 3. 24/7 hotline is not English speaking friendly. The English speaking hotline is available at certain hours. If you dial 1 for English after hours, it will hang up automatically. 4. Traffic jams can happen twice. Even with a 45 minute lay over is not enough to catch your connecting bus.

{'review': "If your travel plans through Europe involve bus travel, you'd be advised NOT TO USE Flix Bus. Unless you want to sit in a bus that promises 3 hour direct travel but makes abrupt stops for passengers, thus extending the travel time. A bus with no wifi. Who can sit for 4 hours or more with no wifi. A bus that changes signage and doesn't adequately inform its passengers. A bus where you pay driver cash and get no receipt. Unless you want all that and more, oh, no bathroom, then, please use them and be inconvenienced. To top it off, I tried to resolve these issues with them online like a good social media activist, I went through Twitter. They contacted me and sought more information. Apparently at 4:53pm they sent me a text advising me that my scheduled bus would not contain the FlixBus logo. 4:53, 7 mins before the scheduled time of departure, how convenient. However, I didn't receive this text, and started to believe it was never sent. I receive alerts from my bank in Nigeria, and other non pertinent texts but not this so called text from Flix Bus that they supposedly sent. In between my discussions with their social media customer service person, he/she proceeded to block me after telling me there was nothing that could be done in regards to my missing the bus, or getting me a receipt to account for my expenses made abroad. what kind of business are you running when you can't offer customers receipts or refunds for your shabby notification methods. Plus, now wifi and no bathroom is no huge sell either.", 'stars': '1.0'}
