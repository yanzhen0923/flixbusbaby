F√∂r det priset hade jag v√§ntat mig v√§rre, s√§rskilt med tanke p√• recensionerna jag hittade h√§r. N√§r ni kollar igenom alla dessa, kom ih√•g: det √§r alltid gn√§llspikarna som skriker h√∂gst p√• n√§tet. Detta √§r vad ni beh√∂ver veta: har ni en begr√§nsad budget och en dag p√• er att ta er fr√•n plats A till plats B, √•k med Flixbus.

Det g√•r ungef√§r 3-4 bussar per dag: en p√• morgonen, en mitt p√• dagen, en p√• kv√§llen och eventuellt en p√• natten. Bussen kommer +/-5 minuter avg√•ngstiden beroende p√• dagen och trafiken. En g√•ng blev bussen f√∂rsenad till en station, ca 20 minuter, och det var pga ett v√§garbete s√• det var inget konstigt med det, chauff√∂ren minskade f√∂rseningen till 10 minuter vid n√§sta stopp. F√∂rsta g√•ngen jag √•kte med dem klagade en mamma p√• att toaletten inte fungerade och chauff√∂ren stannade p√• f√∂rsta st√§lle han kunde och fixade felet p√• mindre √§n 5 minuter. Kan inte s√§ga att de k√§nns muntra och glada varje g√•ng men det har jag nog aldrig upplevt busschauff√∂rer vara. Jag ska inte ljuga om s√§tena, det √§r v√§ldigt tr√•ngt. Kliver man p√• senare √§n startstationen f√•r man r√§kna med att alla, jag upprepar ALLA, som √•ker sj√§lva tar upp tv√• s√§ten f√∂r sig sj√§lva och inte riktigt f√∂rst√•r det h√§r med att √•ka kommunalt.

Det √§r aldrig smockfullt men bussen fylls p√• r√§tt bra under resans g√•ng s√• ta h√§nsyn till alla som kommer in. Det √§r m√•nga par som f√•r sitta separat f√∂r att vissa personer √§r f√∂r envisa f√∂r att flytta p√• sig.F√∂r priset √§r det en sjukt v√§rd resa som g√•r v√§ldigt snabbt. Om det √§r superviktigt att ni kommer fram en s√§rskild tid och har n√•t viktigt m√∂te kanske ni ska v√§lja n√•got annat men f√∂r n√•n som g√§rna sparar in p√• reskostnaderna, go for it.\r\n            ', 'stars': '5'}
