The service girl told us to go to the station\'s FlixBus customer service office.At the customer service office, the representative told us we should take the metro to get back to our hotel.

F√∂r det priset hade jag v√§ntat mig v√§rre, s√§rskilt med tanke p√• recensionerna jag hittade h√§r. N√§r ni kollar igenom alla dessa, kom ih√•g: det √§r alltid gn√§llspikarna som skriker h√∂gst p√• n√§tet. Detta √§r vad ni beh√∂ver veta: har ni en begr√§nsad budget och en dag p√• er att ta er fr√•n plats A till plats B, √•k med Flixbus. Jag betalar 50 kronor f√∂r att ta mig fr√•n Bor√•s till Norrk√∂ping, en resa som kunde ha kostat 300 kronor eller mer, och f√∂r n√•gon med studentbudget √§r det riktigt sk√∂nt att ha alternativet. Det g√•r ungef√§r 3-4 bussar per dag: en p√• morgonen, en mitt p√• dagen, en p√• kv√§llen och eventuellt en p√• natten. Bussen kommer +/-5 minuter avg√•ngstiden beroende p√• dagen och trafiken. En g√•ng blev bussen f√∂rsenad till en station, ca 20 minuter, och det var pga ett v√§garbete s√• det var inget konstigt med det, chauff√∂ren minskade f√∂rseningen till 10 minuter vid n√§sta stopp. F√∂rsta g√•ngen jag √•kte med dem klagade en mamma p√• att toaletten inte fungerade och chauff√∂ren stannade p√• f√∂rsta st√§lle han kunde och fixade felet p√• mindre √§n 5 minuter. Kan inte s√§ga att de k√§nns muntra och glada varje g√•ng men det har jag nog aldrig upplevt busschauff√∂rer vara. Jag ska inte ljuga om s√§tena, det √§r v√§ldigt tr√•ngt. Kliver man p√• senare √§n startstationen f√•r man r√§kna med att alla, jag upprepar ALLA, som √•ker sj√§lva tar upp tv√• s√§ten f√∂r sig sj√§lva och inte riktigt f√∂rst√•r det h√§r med att √•ka kommunalt.

Det √§r aldrig smockfullt men bussen fylls p√• r√§tt bra under resans g√•ng s√• ta h√§nsyn till alla som kommer in. Det √§r m√•nga par som f√•r sitta separat f√∂r att vissa personer √§r f√∂r envisa f√∂r att flytta p√• sig.F√∂r priset √§r det en sjukt v√§rd resa som g√•r v√§ldigt snabbt. Om det √§r superviktigt att ni kommer fram en s√§rskild tid och har n√•t viktigt m√∂te kanske ni ska v√§lja n√•got annat men f√∂r n√•n som g√§rna sparar in p√• reskostnaderna, go for it.', 'stars': '5'}

I did not hav an option, boarded the bus with my mother, and was virtually kicked out of the bus somewhere in the outskirts of Bratislava with no knowledge on how to get to our hotel. By sheer luck, I decided to board a bus did not know how to pay for the fares but at that moment I did not care, which got us into the downtown area where we did find a cab. Cab driver was just as rude, but we did manage to get to our hotel. What is wrong with people who are working in the service business and are so rude? Do they not need our business?Again, do not use Flexibus if you are not familiar with the drop off area. You will not receive any help to get you to your destination.', 'stars': '1'}

I have used this service five or so times in the last 4 years, and usually have a fine experience.

The seats are fairly comfortable, the cities they drive to are convenient, and they have Wi-Fi on the bus (though to watch movies I would recommend downloading them beforehand).

Furthermore, they do not always speak any language other than their native tongue making it extremely challenging to understand information. And people are always jockeying and fighting for position since you do not have reserved seats. All these complaints are somewhat unimportant compared to what we went through this morning. We were stopped at a passport checkpoint and the drivers took off after without giving us passports back immediately only to realize they had the wrong passports from another bus. We then had to turn around yo retrieve our correct passports which put us off route 3 hours causing missed connections and much anxiety. As a traveler, being in a foreign country without your passport due to the drivers, who were entrusted to assure you received the passport back, leaving without them is a nightmare.", 'stars': '3'}

When travelling to and from Groningen it was much cheaper than the train and just as quick or even faster due to a more direct route. On the bus ride up from Amsterdam there was good Wifi and the bus went direct to Groningen. It was on time and not crowded.When I took the 16:05 bus south to Enschede on Oct. 15th, 2017, there was no wifi and the driver got lost twice. In Hengelo, he clearly did not know where the station was as he turned the bus around at one point, driving over a median, as there was no appropriate spot to turn, and then backtracking a ways. Then near the Universite de Twente, he clearly didn't know where he had to stop and so again he had to turn the bus around, this time on some grass. Then he entered the road against a Do not Enter sign, having to do an awkward multi-point turn across 3 lanes. I was happy to finally make it to the Enschede central station, and get off the bus.

{'review': 'Let me tell you, the trip was a debacle. Our bus crashed into the back of a car on the autobahn, so we spent quite a while on the side of the highway whilst the cops came and sorted it out. During the entire crash process and aftermath, not a word was spoken to the passengers to tell us what was going on. The drivers completely ignored us and acted as though this was totally normal. As far as I know, the bus drivers didn\'t speak Danish, English, or German, I only ever heard them speak in another language that I didn\'t recognize.The driver seemed to want to compensate for the delay caused by the crash, by speeding to speeds that no bus should go, and overtaking everything in his path, which was pretty terrifying. I couldn\'t actually see the driver\'s speedo gauge to say for sure, but I could swear that we were driving over the legal speed limits at times, on parts of the trip with 100kmph limits.We nearly crashed at least two more times because our driver tried to just merge into the side of cars on the autobahn instead of waiting for a gap big enough for the bus. The bus had zero Wifi access, but at least the bus had plugs for charging. There was a toilet on board, but when I went to use it (about 3 hrs into a 12 hr ride) the floor was a pool of urine. I\'m not talking a little dribble here, I\'m talking a pool, where there was no dry space on the floor to step in order to avoid it. I\'m not sure if that was due to the toilet not being cleaned when it was meant to be, or if it was just due to the men on board not being able to aim properly. Either way, getting wee all over my shoes wasn\'t terribly fun.I honestly thought that I might die on that bus ride due to the maniacal driving, which isn\'t really what you want your customer\'s experience to be, and you certainly wouldn\'t want them spreading that to others via word of mouth."Oh mate, how was your bus ride?" "I nearly died and now my shoes are covered in wees!"Two thumbs down, and safe to say that I cancelled my return trip. What do we say to the god of death? Not today, Flixbus.', 'stars': '1'}

He pushed me again as I was trying to record, I called the police as this was clearly assault but before police arrived, my cousin\'s luggage was thrown out of the bus and the bus left to Germany. My cousin was left with the valid ticket, crying, vulnerable, in a terrible state. We both complained to the company, a lady called "Silke from Flixbus" answered that she can not talk to me because I am not their passenger and to my cousin that she should ask the passengers to switch seats (she ignored the fact that my cousin was not even allowed into the bus because she dared to ask if she can sit downstairs).

Comprendo benissimo che si viaggia via terra, il traffico ecc, ma sarebbe auspicabile che il conducente AVVISI durante il tragitto del ritardo,di quanto ritardo si tratta e se aumenta, dirlo al microfono.Gli ultimi 5 viaggi ho avuto tra i 45 minuti alle 3 e passa di ritardo, senza che nessuno ci avvisasse di nulla.2) Le soste. Mi pare di avere intuito che le soste dipendono dal conducente e dal numero di ore che guida.PER√í. √à impensabile affrontare un viaggio di 11 ore, che con il ritardo diventano 14 e non fermarsi se non per far scendere le persone.Va bene che si √® in ritardo, va bene che gli autisti non ne hanno bisogno perch√© si danno il cambio a met√† tratta.Ma ci sono anche i passeggeri, e tanti fanno tratte lunghe (come nel mio caso le famose 11/14 ore, ma  non ero la sola).3)I metodi di comunicazione. Forse √® un mio limite, ma non conosco tutte le lingue europee. Quando il conducente dice qualcosa al microfono, potrebbe fare un piccolo riassunto in inglese. Ripeto magari √® un mio limite,ma in Germania le comunicazioni erano in tedesco e solo in tedesco, in Italia solo in italiano, in Francia solo in francese e io penso a tutti quei poveri passeggeri che non parlano la lingua del posto da cui √® partito il flixbus.4) L'organizzazione. Forse √® un po' generale come affermazione, ma l'organizzazione lascia a desiderare. A partire da : sbarcare alla destinazione e doversi arrampicare da soli per recuperare i bagagli nella stiva (non chiedetemi dove sono i conducenti, non lo so); si arriva ad una destinazione, ma non sai qual'√® perch√© l'autista non la dichiara e con il ritardo non sai se la destinazione √® la tua oppure una fermata prima o dopo;  durante un viaggio E NON STO SCHERZANDO, ad un certo sembrava ci fossero pi√π passeggeri che posti!! O comunque pi√π passeggeri di quelli che dovevano essere. PANICO per buoni 20 minuti,fermi in mezzo al nulla per capire che era successo.Conclusione stretti come sardine abbiamo proseguito il viaggio fino alla fermata dopo dove qualcuno √® sceso.Trovo che flixbus sia un'ottima idea e potrebbe offrire un ottimo servizio.E all'inizio sicuramente era cos√¨.Ma ora prenderne uno, significa imbarcarsi sperando vada tutto per il meglio e partire con almeno due o tre ore di anticipo perch√© il ritardo √® diventato cronico.Un vero peccato.", 'stars': '2'}

{'review': 'Det er da en verden til forskel fra R√∏dbillet at k√∏re med Flixbus. Jeg har nu k√∏rt med Flixbus et par gange og hver gang med forsinkelse. Da jeg i g√•r fredag k√∏rte med Flixbus fra K√∏benhavn til Randers var rejsen berammet til at skulle vare 4 timer og 55 minutter. R√∏dbillet tog normalt 5 timer. Flixbus k√∏rte fra DGI byen til tiden, men allerede inden alle passagerer i K√∏benhavn var samlet op, var bussen forsinket, og da vi n√•ede Frederica var bussen forsinket 50 minutter. Der var 3 chauff√∏rskift inden vi n√•ede Randers, hvilket jo heller ikke mindsker rejsetiden. Chauff√∏rer, der virkede presset af forsinkelsen og flere trafikulykker p√• motorvejen, k√∏rte lidt p√• m√• og f√• ad omveje for at undg√• trafikk√∏er. Det virkede heller ikke lige gennemt√¶nkt, da en af chauff√∏rerne pludselig og i h√∏j fart drejede skarpt fra. Lidt ubehageligt.Rejsen fra K√∏benhavn til Randers kom op p√• at vare 6 timer og 10 minutter. En rejse, hvor der ikke som med R√∏dbillet bliver holdt et kvarters pause, hvor passagererne havde mulighed for at komme ud at str√¶kke benene og komme p√• toilet. Hvorfor kan dette ikke lade sig g√∏re med Flixbus? Ok, man kan benytte toilettet i bussen, men her er d√•rlig plads, der var ikke toiletpapir, ingen s√¶be og kun det samme h√•ndkl√¶de alle kunne bruge. Da vi n√•ede Randers kunne vi pga. cykell√∏b ikke k√∏re til bussens bestemmelssted, men blev sat af et andet sted i byen. Dette blev der ikke orienteret om i bussen, s√• kun dem, der var oppe at sp√∏rge chauff√∏ren vidste besked om dette afs√¶tningssted. Det gav lidt forvirring og selv m√•tte jeg, hvad jeg ikke havde med i min beregning tage en taxa ind til byen. Jeg oplevede ogs√•, da jeg inden min rejse ville √¶ndre min billet, at den f√∏rst skulle annulleres, hvilket kostede et gebyr p√• 10 kr. Man skal t√¶nke sig om, inden man k√∏ber billet med Flixbus. Det kan hurtigt blive dyrt, hvis man vil foretage √¶ndringer. Samtidig skal man have god tid, stor t√•lmodighed og ikke have for mange aftaler samme dag.Der er himmelvid forskel p√• kvaliteten og servicen hos R√∏dbillet og Flixbus, og jeg kan ikke anbefale bussen. H√•ber ikke de overlever, hvis ikke de er villige til at √¶ndre deres koncept.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Min k√¶reste og jeg har nu ventet i mere end 2 m√•neder p√• at f√• vores penge. Hvordan er det n√•et hertil??Vi havde glade tilbage i februar m√•ned bestilt fire billetter hos Abildskou fra Aarhus til Hamborg til vores ferie i juli m√•ned. I l√∏bet af for√•ret overtager Flixbus Abildskou. Det er der i og for sig ikke noget i vejen med. Indtil...Min k√¶reste er lidt bekymret dagene op til ferien pga. den store ferietrafik i Tyskland, s√• hun overtaler mig til at ringe til Flixbus for at h√∏re deres mening om trafikforholdene - de m√• trods alt have erfaringen og vide, om vi kan forvente at blive forsinket, da vi skal n√• et fly videre fra Hamborg. Jeg f√•r fat p√• deres "kundeservice" og oplyser vores bookingnummer, hvortil de svarer, at ‚Äùdet nummer eksisterer ikke‚Äù. Men, siger jeg, jeg sidder og l√¶ser h√∏jt direkte fra den mail, jeg har modtaget med f√∏lgende bookingnummer‚Ä¶ ‚ÄùDet kan ikke passe, for vores bookingnumre begynder med 81XXX‚Äù, og om jeg nu l√¶ser rigtigt?? Ok, dame, h√∏r lige her. Jeg har modtaget en mail, og der st√•r ret tydeligt, at bookingnummeret er YYY. ‚ÄùN√•√•√•√•√•√•√•√•hhh, det er nok fordi, Abildskou brugte andre numre end os. Lad mig lige sl√• op‚Ä¶‚Äù Hmmm. S√•ledes kommer vi efter 7-8 minutters hyggelig konversation frem til, at jo, vi har godt nok bestilt en rejse for 4 personer fra Aarhus til Hamborg 8. juli. S√• spr√¶nger bomben. Den meget insisterende servicedame, som vil have ret, fort√¶ller mig, at de slet ikke k√∏rer til Hamborg den p√•g√¶ldende dag, vi har bestilt billetter til. What?! Jeg sp√∏rger, hvorfor de ikke har kontaktet os og informeret os dette? De kan da ikke bare aflyse en rejse uden at give besked, hvortil jeg f√•r at vide, at "Jeg kunne da bare have ringet og spurgt!" Undskyld, hvad behager?!! Derfra g√•r det s√• kun ned af bakke... Efter at have oparbejdet al min viljestyrke for ikke at svare igen p√• den ubeh√∏vlethed, fors√∏ger jeg at f√• personen, som burde ud√∏ve service, til at foresl√• alternativer og h√∏re om l√∏sninger - vi skal af sted om 1 d√∏gn og skal n√• en flyver... Det ender dog med, at der ingen hj√¶lp er at hente i l√∏bet af de n√¶ste 20 minutter i telefonen. Vi f√•r oplyst, at vi kan f√• vores penge retur, men skal ans√∏ge om det inde p√• deres hjemmeside (vi har afbestillingsforsikring) - som servicepersonen heller ikke vil sende os et link til. Det m√• vi selv rode med at finde frem. Dagen ender med, at vi f√•r sendt en penge-returans√∏gning til Flixbus, bestilt DSB-billetter til Hamborg, tager af sted p√• ferie og glemmer alt om Flixbus for et par uger.MEN... Tilbage i Danmark, mens vi nyder ferieminderne, kommer det til os, at vi vist ikke har f√•et vores penge retur fra Flixbus. Vi kontakter dem derfor i telefonen. Det er s√• anden gang, vi oplever den mest ubeh√∏vlede serviceperson, vi nogensinde har oplevet. Vedkommende "kan" f√∏rst ikke finde nogen oplysninger p√• os, og han har aldrig h√∏rt om, at man kan f√• penge retur. Efter t√•lmodigt at have forklaret ham hele vores historie, finder han dog langt om l√¶nge ud af (et kvarter senere), at vores sag er landet hos deres √∏konomiafdeling. Vi sp√∏rger til, om han vil v√¶re venlig at se efter, hvor langt sagen s√• er hos dem? Men det kan han ‚Äùvirkelig ikke hj√¶lpe os med, Han er jo ikke ansat i deres √∏konomiafdeling, vel? Vi kan selv ringe til dem og h√∏re, hvis vi vil vide mere.‚Äù Ok. Kan du s√• give os nummeret til √∏konomiafdelingen? ‚ÄùNej, den har jeg ikke. Den kan I google, hvis I vil snakke med dem.‚ÄùDyb ind√•nding‚Ä¶ Vi finder (selv!) frem til en mail til √∏konomiafdelingen og skriver til dem for at h√∏re, hvad status er. Efter et par mailkorrespondancer frem og tilbage, f√•r vi at vide, at ‚ÄùFlixbus er glade for at informere os om, at vi kan f√• en VOUCHER (tilgodebevis), som vi skal bruge inden for et √•r i deres busser‚Äù. Det var lige omkring her, jeg detonerede f√∏rste gang. Vi har k√∏bt en rejse, de ikke kan levere. De aflyser og informerer os ikke om det. Kun rent tilf√¶ldigt finder vi selv ud af det. Vi bliver lovet at f√• pengene retur af deres ‚Äùservicemedarbejder‚Äù. Vi har endda k√∏bt afbestillingsforsikring, s√• der burde overhovedet ikke v√¶re noget at rafle om‚Ä¶ Min besindige k√¶reste form√•r dog at holde mig i ro, s√• vi p√¶nt skriver tilbage til Flixbus, at dette er under ingen omst√¶ndigheder tilfredsstillende, og forklarer ovenst√•ende. Derefter kommer n√¶ste slaviske mailkorrespondance, hvor Flixbus vender tilbage til os p√• mail (gerne med 1-2 ugers svartid) for at f√• flere ‚Äùoplysninger, som er n√∏dvendige‚Äù, s√•som bookingnummer, bankkonto, rejseoplysninger, osv. Langt om l√¶nge modtager vi f√∏lgende:‚Äù Gladly, we are now going to refund the amount of 1.119,11 kr. within several working days.‚Äù‚ÄúSeveral‚Äù kommer til at holde, idet vi efter en uge modtager 887 kr. Det er nu en m√•ned siden! Hvor er de sidste 232 kr., vi skulle have retur?!?! Vi har henvendt os igen, men de ‚Äùbeklager bare ulejligheden‚Äù‚Ä¶ Mit r√•d er derfor ‚Äì brug ikke Flixbus!

{'review': 'Hello,I would like to inform you about some issues we had with Flixbus on 08 th and 9 thSeptember 2017. Our names are Claudio P. and Mariangela C.On 8 th September, we were standing at the Flixbus stop in Rotterdam (bookingno. 8.....9) when we received an email informing that the bus was 3 hourslate. We, like the other passengers waiting for the same bus, read this email only45 minutes later as we didn‚Äôt have internet access. Maybe through a textmessage would have been better. We then bought 2 train tickets for Eindhovenspending ‚Ç¨ 38 extra. Just so you know, we didn‚Äôt receive any kind of assistance,any emails offering a refund. According to your terms and conditions, we shouldbe entitled to be refunded in full.The following day at 9.35 we took the bus 080 riding from Eindhoven to London(return tickets 8....5) scheduled for 9.20 am. After 10 minutes, the buswas stopped for the driver changeover. The real problems begin from here. Afterleaving Eindhoven, the bus started to release a foul-smelling. Some passengerscomplained and the driver explained us his colleague didn‚Äôt empty the tank; wecouldn‚Äôt use the toilet for the entire journey. Ok, it‚Äôs a low- cost service, but atleast you can prevent your customers from getting sick.We were approaching Antwerp and the driver complained the GPS didn‚Äôt work.He didn‚Äôt know how to reach Antwerp bus station; the navigation system kept onleading him to the wrong direction. People tried to communicate with the driverbut he could speak only French. Just a quick remark, the GPS was setting toDutch Language and I have the doubt the driver couldn‚Äôt understand directions.Finally, a lady who had to be dropped off at Antwerp Bus Station, guided thedriver to destination. Some passenger became nervous, we were facing anaccumulated delay of about 2 hours; a man, who needed to reach Brugesshouted at the driver and the police was called. They spent at least 20 minutesto try to calm down the furious passenger.Same situation and same problems to reach Bruges and De Panne stations. Thedriver lost the control of situation. He was visible stressed and didn‚Äôt have a cluewhere he had to go. He committed some traffic and driving offences: he used hismobile phone to liaise with Flixbus Headquarter, he failed to stop at traffic lights,he ignored zebra crossings making things dangerous for pedestrians, he stoppedthe bus on the city tram tracks in De Panne... do I have to carry on? Somepassengers took him photos and videos.When we realised, he could speak a little Italian, I helped and guided him to theChannel Tunnel using my phone. By the time we arrived, the ferry we weresupposed to board had left, and we waited almost 2 hours to get the firstavailable. He was exhausted and slept a bit before boarding and continuing ourjourney but before, we had the chance to chat a little. He admitted he didn‚Äôtknow the route and he was replacing one of his colleagues. He said he is fromMarocco and has 14 years‚Äô experience driving bus but he never faced a situationlike that. He gave me his mobile number.I had to guided him again to reach the final stop; we reach Victoria Coach Stationat 9.35 pm. The arrival was scheduled for 5.30 pm. We missed our flights toSpain and we had to stay in hotel for that night. Therefore, we ask to be refundedfor all the extra money we had to spend for your incompetence.All the receipts and tickets are enclosed to this letter.', 'stars': '1'}

There are 12 different forms and none are title refund request.The automated response had nothing to do with my email and my refund request. I then called them to clarify and they said they have so MANY EMAILS that it can take up to 4 weeks to get a response. None of this departments speak to each other, so everyone is confused.I then told her that this was unbelievable. They made a mistake and then I have to wait 4 weeks for even a proper and contextual response. You won\'t believe this, but she said this is normal customer service procedures in Germany. That they have strict rules and that are very efficient. WOW! NEVER TAKE THIS COMPANY! They are basically Criminals, read their response below.This there response. KEEP in mind, I have NEVER Boarded the BUS! They aren\'t even reading anything. "If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding. We also hope to be able to convince you of the quality of our service in the near future again and to welcome you on board of one of our green buses soon."', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "As a musician flixbus is not an option. They only allow you to take instruments such as guitars, violins and violas in the luggage trunk. Instrument insurance policies do not cover this, and the risk of irrectifiable damage to your instrument is huge. Most musicians that were ever on tour know that violins fit in overhead compartments, between your legs or when there is space; on the floor of the seat next to you. Flixbus employees are many times fine to let you board with a violin. But sometimes there's that one employee that denies you boarding and refuses to let you show that it fits in the overhead. If you're on your way to something important that day they say no, you're screwed. Don't risk it, take the train or another company instead.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'So, I have been a loyal customer for the past weeks while traveling in Europe with Flixbus. Unfortunately, I have lived a very disappointing event and I would like to share it with you so you can take your mesures next time you think of traveling with this company.Last Wednesday, August 23rd 2017, I booked a trip from Brussels to Maastricht at 4:35pm (booking number: #8045960869). I have arrived at the train station in Brussels where the Flixbus buses park at 4:20pm. While waiting for the bus (and none of them had a sign with Maastricht or Krak√≥w), I went and asked a man with the Flixbus uniform about the arrival of the train. He searched all of the buses in the terminal and asked one chauffeur about it and they both said it was late and on it\'s way (because at that time many of the buses were late because of traffic). So we stayed there and waited more. At that moment, the Flixbus agent was gone and no one was there to give assistance to all the people waiting for their late buses and we all found this very unsatisfying. Reaching 5pm, because no one was there to help us, I decided to call the customer service by phone and have more information about the late bus. The lady who spoke to me on the phone took my booking number and my personal information and told me the bus was still on it\'s way and it should take around 10 min for him to arrive. After 20 min, no sign of that bus. So I called again. Now, this agent on the phone told me that the bus was never late and it was there on time and left at 4:35pm. At that point, we were all shocked by this assistance from the agents on the phone and in place. Everyone said that the bus was on it\'s way and we could not know in any way that it was on time because the Flixbus agent on place went and searched and asked and said the bus is not here. I explained this situation to the lady on the phone and, after 20min of explaining our frustration from me and other passengers in the same situation, she offered me a 12euros voucher (code: CUS8PFACC\u200b given at 5:57pm) to use to buy another ticket for the next bus at 9:05pm. This was the minimum she could offer me, but because of the stress and tiredness I was living I accepted to be able to get to my destination. Now, I asked her to book the ticket for me because I had no computer with me and she said it was going to be 3euros more. At this point, the service was getting worst. I refused and went to book it on my phone. Because all this wasn\'t enough, the voucher was not applicable on the Flixbus application (there was no place where we could apply it) and while booking the tickets it charged me the full amount! I loved traveling with your company but this was too much for me. Now the voucher is expired and I lost money. I then sent a complain to their customer service and the answer was:" Dear FlixBus customer, Thank you for your message.We can assure you that our time schedules are planned with great care to transport our customers comfortably and on time.We regret that this did not work out this time.However at times delays are caused by events which we, despite greatest care and preparation, cannot influence.If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding. We also hope to be able to convince you of the quality of our service in the near future again and to welcome you on board of one of our green buses soon. Kind regards, "This is NO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. They don\'t consider your situation and neither try to accommodate you. I understand that it is a low cost bus company but I believe customer support and satisfaction is the minimum they can offer.', 'stars': '1'}

For the 2nd trip, we received a text message 30 min after our scheduled departure time saying that the bus would be arriving 50 min late.... No idea why they could not disclose this at the beginning, but you had 25 very angry people waiting on a polluted curb in a shady part of town with no news or way to contact the company. Turns out our trip had in fact been cancelled, because by the time they arrived it was the next scheduled time for the day. We tried calling the numbers listed on their website and Facebook page several times, but only got an automated recording in German, despite pressing the option for English. What's more, they say this number should be operated 24 hours so that is false advertising. I am completely appalled with this experience and their lack of care or attention when it came to a resolution.

Then the bus drove into a traffic jam that was reported on GoogleMaps by the time we departed (and of course there was a possibility to go around) -> another 45 minutes delay.Information about the delay was only in German, the driver did NOT (nor even tried to) speak English.No apology for the 90 minutes delay.Plus the great free internet on board means that you get 150MB of data for a 4.5 hours (that turned out to be 6 hours) trip and then they cut you off.Plus no seat reservation causes a herd of people trying to board as soon as possible, so that they could sit together.

{'review': "So, me and my boyfriend were supposed to go on a vacation to Biograd na moru. I was leaving from Beograd at 1.50am and he was departuring from Ljubljana at about 5am. We were supposed to meet in Zagreb at 7.10am and then wait for our bus to Biograd at 9.30am. His bus was 3h late so we didn't make it to our bus in time. While I understand Flixbus can't control the traffic I don't understand why noone was there to help me. I was alone in Zagreb for 3h running and asking around what we were supposed to do, while my boyfriend was still on the bus to Zagreb. First i went to the Flixbus ticket office where a lady didn't even try to help me and just told me she doesn't know and looked at me as waiting for me to leave. Then finally, I got some help from a guy who pointed me to the Flixbus office as if they can help me there. The Flixbus office was closed with no signs where anyone was and where i can find anyone that can help me. Next i went to the information point where again i was just kindly asked to leave because the information point here doesnt cooperate with the Flixbus company. Then naturally i got tired of running around with my huge backpack so i went back to the place where Flixbus sells their tickets where now the guy who has helped me before, was selling the tickets and I told him that there is noone around to help me and that i desperatly need help. He was then kind enough to give me the number of the Flixbus information point where I was just told that i have to rebuy the tickets and then got hung up because of bad cell connection. So I called again and i got a man on the phone, wich actually tried to help me, until i was put on hold. Forever. The guy just disappeared for about half an hour until my boyfriend finally came and i just hung up because there was noone on the phone anyways. We then got everything sorted out when we found the emplyee working at Flixbus with the green shirt and he was very kind and helped us rebook a new ticket, so everything was sorted out. Now, my vacation is over and i wan't to go home. And after alredy waiting 3h at the bus station, I get a message 3mins before the bus was supposed to be here that it is going to be late for 1h55mins. Now my problem with Flixbus now is:1st.: The organization. There is no organization what so ever. I dont understand why the people working at Flixbus aren't more connected. I dont understand how I, was left walking around the bus station for 3h asking for help and noone could call anyone and ask what was going on.2nd.: Timing. If you download the Flixbus app it strickly tells you, you have to be at the bus station on time, or actually even 20min before the bus arrives. So what I expect from them that if the bus is going to be late, it is not said 3mins before the bus was supposed to be here, but at least 20mins before. So my experience with the Flixbus was that eventhough the bus itself is ok and has all the things it offeres, the buses are late and noone really helps you unless you're lucky enough to spot on of the employees in the green shirts.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'I wrote it to the FlixBus 2 weeks ago: I bought tickets to my sister on your homepage from Florence to Budapest. She start her journey in Florence at 30th of July, but because of technical problems the bus stopped at 04:00 (31th of July) on the highway. So she was call me and I was call you to ask about the next steps I got the information you send an other bus and she can travel with the next bus from Ljubljana.The new bus arrived to the highway around 9 o\'clock and to Ljubljana at 10:30. Bus driver told all of the people have to came back at 14:45 who go Vienna or Budapest. My sister go back in time but the bus driver told her and an other passenger that they are not on the list, so my sister ask them to call the company what happen but the driver refused this and was shouting that ,,go to the hell" or he call police... As I know the driver was very unpolite with all the passangers and also aggressive with my sister.After this we called your company and she got a ticket for 1th of August. After a short late the bus arrived at 01:30. This bus went to Vienna not directly to Budapest, so after an other change and an other late the bus arrived to Budapest around 11:30 (1th of August).It isn\'t normal to arrive from Florence to Budapest on the third day from the start of the journey. The bus driver\'s behavior is not acceptable at all and I think I will write a review to your Facebook page not because of the many late but this impolite and aggressive staff. I read the bus passengers rights in the EU and also the national law and the minimum rights are these:If your long-distance journey (more than 250km) was scheduled to last more than 3 hours and departure is delayed by more than 90 minutes or cancelled, you are also entitled to:- Either you can get a refund for your ticket and where necessary free journey back to the service\'s initial departure point - you can later complain and claim a refund for the ticket plus compensation worth 50% of the ticket price.- meals and refreshments - proportionate to the waiting time or delay- accommodation if you have to stay overnightIt was a horrible travel full with wrong informations and services from your company and unacceptable behavior from the staff, so we expect the compensation from the ticket price and also a compensation because of the missing services like meals and refreshments.After 2 weeks they answered 1/3 of my questions:,,We can assure you that our time schedules are planned with great care to transport our customers comfortably and on time.We regret that this did not work out this time.However at times delays are caused by events which we, despite greatest care and preparation, cannot influence.If a departure is more than 120 minutes late from the scheduled departure time and a customer withdraws from the trip, a refund can be claimed. Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride."So they not really care that my sister arrived on the 3. day after this (normally) short way, they even don\'t care about my other questions about the food and drink what they have to give in this situation or the fact that they gave totally wrong information about the new bus in the phone.', 'stars': '1'}

The bus was one hour late and the driver decided to travel through the small alleys of the Belgian countryside, claiming that there was an accident on the road.

{'review': "If there were an option for 0 stars, I would absolutely choose that. An unexpected detour in the Paris metro services caused our 25 minute trip to the cdg bus stop into a 75 minute trip. This happened last minute with no warning to us. Instead of being 40 minutes early, we were late. We called customer service to ask what we should do. They told us that the bus was running 5-10 minutes late, and that we may be able to make it. We were underground without phone data, so we could not cancel online. All we could do was make calls. By the end of this we traveled over an hour to cdg only to miss our bus. To attempt to resolve this issue, we called customer service. Mistake. They were rude, and extremely unhelpful. They blamed us for the metro detour, and said they were taking our 100 euros and there was nothing we could do about it. Flixbus stole ‚Ç¨100 from 2 college kids. And couldn't have been more rude. I cannot emphasize enough what a pathetic, unethical company this is. I will NEVER give these thiefs my money again, and I strongly encourage no one else does either. For anyone that rated them 5 stars, they got lucky on their 1 trip they took with this company. I have taken 4-5 trips with flixbus in the last 3 weeks, and each one has been worse than the last. Choose eurolines. They have similar if not better prices, along with good customer service. They have better wifi and more leg room. Infinitly better. Please don't give these crooks more money.

{'review': 'We have been customers of Flixbus for quite a long time.This time we decided to travel from the Flixbus stop situated nearby the Hague Central Station to Munich (line 268 at 18.00, 28 July 2017 ).The trip began later than we expected because the bus was late for an hour and we had not been duly informed about that in advance. Despite this fact, we were pretty confident that there would be enough time for a transfer to another bus in Monchengladbach which was going directly to Munich.To the contrary,I would say that the driver‚Äôs actions were professional, notwithstanding the fact he had another trip earlier this day, as well as he was alone during this trip, that, to the best of my knowledge, are not in line with the company‚Äôs policy and principles which provide that there should be two drivers in the bus.It is worth mentioning, that we were not the only persons who were supposed to have transfers in different cities, some other people were in the same position.With regard to the timing, I would like to underline, that our transfer was scheduled for 00.12 am, 29 July 2017, at the Flixbus stop in Monchengladbach.Unfortunately, on our way to Monchengladbach the bus suddenly broke down. It happened in Roermond (the Netherlands) at around 11.20 pm (the electricity was fallen for unknown reason).\xa0 Therefore, we contacted the Flixbus customer service in order to find any solution. The company reassured us that they would do their best to provide relevant assistance. Regretabbly, the bus was fixed only 2 hours after, but the customer service did not respond to our numerous calls.\xa0We arrived to Monchengladbach at around 03.00 am and made another attempt to reach the customer service by phone, to no avail. It is noteworthy, that there were neither hotels nor taxi nearby the Flixbus stop. Since there was no possibility to get to Munich by other transport, except by train or taxi, both are very expensive means of transport, we had no choice, but started to search the hotels to stay for that night.In the morning of 29 July, after having almost sleepless night, we finally reached the representative of the customer service by phone who was surprised by what happened last night.

{'review': 'The worst travel experience of my life. My trip from Belgium to Stockholm was ruined by a really late bus and terrible customer service. Be ready to have your number blocked and be stranded in a foreign city at 3am. Oh? And you speak only English? No problem! Drivers will make fun of you to the other bus riders and be really rude to you. A trip that should have cost me 100‚Ç¨ ended up costing 250‚Ç¨. Oh and they knew it was bad. Every other Flixbus I took I recieved a email asking me to give them feed back but not this time. That\'s the short summary here\'s the story. I took a bus from Ghent to Cologne on Saturday July 29th 2017 with another planned from Cologne to Hamburg 2.5 hours later. The bus was 3.5 hours late. Upon our late arrival the bus drivers called ahead to ensure I could get to Hamburg. The lady on the phone said it should be no problem and I would receive a text confirming my ride on the next bus. Not only did I not receive a text the woman refused to put me on another bus to Hamburg. She said I would be refunded and then I could buy another ticket however, the bus to Hamburg was full so I\'d have to wait until tomorrow. I had to cancel all my buses and trains and rebook everything costing me an extra 100‚Ç¨. Not to mention I was stranded in a foreign city and was forced to find accommodation at 3am! And when you called back the Flixbus operater did not pick up the phone. The next morning I bought a ticket to Kiel (Mind you I had to get to Stockholm somehow) it stopped at Dortmund. My second bus was 1 hour late from Dortmund to the next cities. The bus driver was not pleasent when he realized I spoke no German. At one of our stops he was making his usual announcements in German and the girl sitting next to me explained everyone was laughing because he said "unless your like this American who has no clue what is go in on because she doesn\'t understand me but pretends she does". I arrive at kiel almost 1.5 hours late. Causing me to almost miss my train. (Which I had to rebook for a substantial sum) My bus from Copenhagen to Stockholm ends up being being 2 hours. Mind you I\'m a student and by this time I had no choice but to sit by a 9 hour bus ride because my missed train to Stockholm was much to expensive to rebook.  All and all I took nearly 12 buses in 1 month And or than half of them were unpleasant or just late. Customer service center is terrible and it\'s just easier to pay more and take a train or fly.', 'stars': '2'}

We asked the bus-driver how late we were and to our fear he told us "around 3 hours"; meaning we would miss our next bus. We immediately called flixbus, who simply asked us to call them an hour before our arrival. When we called again, we were on hold for 45 minutes and instead tried calling them on another phone. Suddenly there were no waiting time, but now we talked to another person who again had to identify the problem. He would call us back after 5 minutes, but after 15 minutes we figured it wouldn\'t happen. We called him twice before he picked up the phone. He booked us on another bus, where we would have to change in Frankfurt and change again in Hamburg, where we could take a train to Copenhagen. On our way to this bus, that would add many hours to our already long journey, we saw a flixbus driving directly to Hamburg, and took the chance and asked the driver, if we could join this bus instead. after a call, he told us that it was the bus we originally were supposed to take directly to Copenhagen. To our luck it had been waiting due to a technical error. This bus (from K√∂ln to Copenhagen) didn¬¥t hold any breaks, which meant we could not buy any food or stretch our legs, and we were still 3 hours late on our arrival in Copenhagen.So basically:2 times 3 hours delay.Blocked our phone number, when we needed help.Luck saved the day, NOT Flixbus.', 'stars': '1'}

There was also enough leg space for my long legs.The second trip, however, was delayed, and the bus that arrived was clearly a replacement. Therefor, it lacked wifi, overhead space was a little smaller, but still just enough to fit my backpack, and leg-space was only just acceptable for my legs.Overall, assuming you will have the actual flixbus to drive you, I can highly recommend it.

Once you decide to board the bus even after a delay and the transportation has taken place, i.e. the contract was fulfilled, refunding or compensation is not possible. That also goes for any delays that occur during your bus ride.We regret that we cannot meet your request in this case and hope for your understanding.

{'review': 'Rejste til Berlin fra K√∏benhavn og retur i juli 2017. F√∏rst m√•tte jeg slet ikke komme p√• bussen, da jeg ikke st√•r p√• passagerlisten - selv om jeg st√•r og flagrer med min billet og mit pas. Chauff√∏ren vil ikke kommunikere med mig og bliver ved med at sige "momento". Til sidst insisterer jeg og s√¶tter mig ind! Under hele turen vil kan/chauff√∏rerne ikke kommunikere med mig eller mange af de √∏vrige passagerer p√• hverken nordiske sprog, engelsk eller tysk. De var vist rum√¶nere! Ved billetk√∏b til f√¶rgen holder vi meget lang tid, mens den ene chauff√∏r er inde, og den anden diskuterer h√∏jlydt i telefon p√• et sprog, som vi danske passagerer ikke forstod. Vi venter i k√∏ ved f√¶rgelejet i Gedser, der kommer, l√¶sser p√•, l√¶sser af - og s√• sejler den, og der er to timer til n√¶ste f√¶rge. Vi bliver overhovedet ikke informeret. Det er f√∏rst, da jeg g√•r ned og siger til chauff√∏rerne, hvad der sker og kr√¶ver noget information, at en ene tager mikrofonen og siger "Zwei Stunde Pause"!!! Det viser sig, finder vi selv ud af (gennem billetkontoret i Gedser), at der ikke var reserveret plads til bussen p√• den p√•g√¶ldende afgang kl. 11.00 - alts√• den afgang, som Flixbus afgang til Berlin skal med hver eneste dag. Vi m√•tte derfor vente to timer ekstra - absolut uacceptabelt p√• en s√•dan baggrund. En del af passagerne var utrygge p√• grund af den manglende information og chauff√∏rernes manglende lyst til at kommunikere med os - en √¶ldre dame ulykkelig, for hun skulle videre med bus til Budapest fra Berlin kl. cirka 17.00 (vi skulle rettidigt ankomme kl. 15.30). En mor med to b√∏rn skulle videre herfra kl. 17.40 og var ogs√• bekymret. Jeg ringede til Flixbus danske afdeling og kom igennem efter 20 minutter. Her talte jeg med en Jonas, der gentagne gange. p√• trods af min gentagne forklaring, blev ved med at insistere p√•, at Flixbus ikke kunne tage ansvar for f√¶rgeafgange. Jeg bad om at tale med hans chef, der gik lidt tid, Jonas kom tilbage og fortsatte i samme rille. Jeg fortalte om vores utryghed ved chauff√∏rerne og insisterede p√• at tale med hans chef. S√• lagde Jonas r√∏ret p√•! Vi ankom til Berlin 2 1/2 time senere end planlagt. Da jeg skulle hjem opstod der ogs√• udfordringer. Bussen kom, alle (ret mange til en dobbeltd√¶kkerbus)gjorde klar, en ansvarlig p√• ZOB (busstationen) fra Flexbus kom til, kiggede oppe foran med en chauff√∏r, og s√• blev d√∏rene lukket, og vi fik at vide, vi skulle vente. Det gjorde vi s√• i en halv times tid. Ingen information - vi var 15 minutter forsinket allerede, chauff√∏rerne gik frustrerede rundt - og INGEN informerede os om, hvad er skete. Vi fandt s√• selv ud af, at ventetiden skyldtes et stenslag i forruden, og det skulle afklares, forsikringsm√¶ssigt, om vi m√•tte k√∏re. Pludselig st√•r der p√• infoskiltet ved bussen, at bussen er aflyst. Igen ingen INFO - alle er vildt frustrerede. Den Flixansvarlige kommer til efter fem minutter, og s√• m√• vi k√∏re alligevel. Han siger dog, p√• tysk, da jeg sp√∏rger, hvad der er sket - at vi har f√•et lov til at k√∏re, men at "han ville ikke g√∏re det". Ikke just noget, der beroliger passagerer, der skal ud p√• en 420 km. lang k√∏retur. Trafikale forsinkelser kan busselskabet ikke klandres for, men ikke at have en pladsreservation (og s√• i den travle ferietid) og ikke ville kommunikere - hverken i bussen eller pr. telefon - det er for mig at se fuldst√¶ndig un√∏dvendigt og uacceptabelt. Jeg rejser aldrig med Flixbusser mere!', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "Flixbus driver ASSAULTED me in the street after I asked for his name to file a complaint about his unprofessional behavior. This happened because I tried to help de-escalate a bad situation, caused by the horrific behavior of the Flixbus staff, which was endangering the safety of an infant child.The driver and other Flixbus staff verbally berated a customer in German for attempting to load a baby carriage into the bus prior to checking in. The customer, a father traveling with his wife and infant, didn't understand German and was reasonably offended at being treated so rudely. The situation escalated to an argument and the driver banned the entire family from riding the bus, even the mother and baby, in the middle of the night, in freezing weather. The father, reasonably, believed this outrageous treatment may be racist, as he and his family were from Africa. I tried to reason with everyone, get everyone to apologize, calm down, and get the family in the bus, since they'd done nothing wrong, especially not the wife and baby. The wife was pleading for the sake of her child, who was in real danger in -2 C, to let them on the bus. When I tried to help, the staff threatened to ban me from the bus as well. They looked like skinheads, by the way.When I got to my destination I asked the driver for his name to file a complaint. When he refused, I started taking video and asked again. Then he chased me out of the bus and attacked me in the street, grabbing me by the neck and pulling my hair.I filed a complaint with the local police.I informed Flixbus, and they blew off my complaint of ASSAULT and the horrible treatment of the family. They also refused to tell me the name of the driver who assaulted me to add to the police report.Regardless of any external circumstances, such an unstable, violent person is a dangerous bus driver. But Flixbus chose to continue to jeopardize the safety and lives of its customers rather than address their problem is staff selection and training.

{'review': "My one-day trip from Brussels to Cologne/ Bonn was a true fiasco because of the delay of the Flixbus buses.In the morning of 01/07, the bus to Cologne/ Bonn (airport) was late for one hour and a half (they notified me about the delay at 6.30, the moment when we were supposed to leave). In the evening, the same day, I was supposed to leave from Cologne/ Bonne (airport) at 21:05. Many people were waiting for the bus and only after one hour after the supposed departure time, Flixbus sent us a SMS saying that the bus will be late for 4 hours and 5 minutes (which in the end were almost 5h).At almost 11 PM there is no train that goes from Bonn to Brussels and no other transportation (except hitchhinking, probably). At 1 o'clock, a bus going to Oostende (via Brussels) parked in the parking area. The driver refused to take a few passengers going to Brussels because our tickets were not valid! I understand his comment, however, since the bus from the same company did not come, it would have been polite to give us an alternative and the option to finally travel to our destination.  Moreover, because drivers' English was limited, we could not communicate and find out why there was such a delay.In the end, after 5 hours of waiting, the bus to Brussels (and then Gent and London) arrived. Drivers did not even mention why caused such a delay and why we have not been informed before our departure about the 5h delay, so we could have potentially find a train to our destinations. I arrived to Brussels at 5 am. In order to avoid all the frustration they caused to me and many other passengers, I think that Flixbus should improve their communication system, train their drivers to answer questions and come up with solutions when such delays happen. They could potentially increase a bit more the prices of the tickets (as they are very cheap at this moment) in order to offer a better service and client support. Moreover, the technology available nowadays could be used to monitor such delays and inform passengers accordingly.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'So, I think this might be the WORST transport company I ever had to deal with - my story is like this:I booked a trip for Stockholm to Gothenburg and return for June 24-27th 2017.First - something happened with the site while paying for my tickets so I got double charged for the same trip. No matter how many times I called and how many mails I wrote - explaining it\'s a double payment made due to a site error, there was no way to get a refund for it. Once I got an email from the customer service confirming that they checked my case and I\'ll get a refund. But no money back. When I asked again what\'s going on - every time a different person form customer service answered there is no way to get my money back for the double payment - only cancel one booking and get the stupid voucher. Second - and the most stupid - 2 hours before my trip I got sms and mail from Flixbus stating that my "booked ride was cancelled with a short time of notice" and call some number for finding alternatives. 2 HOURS BEFORE!!!! Actually they couldn\'t find any alternatives because there was no other bus going to my direction that day. I had to deal with this by myself, with no refund and no other compensation.Again, when asking for a refund, they told me to write another email to customer service. Brief, till today no answer and no refund for a trip cancelled by Flixbus, only an this email "Delays mostly occur due to external factors, such as weather conditions, last minute changes of bus stops or congestion. We can therefore not be held responsible for such matters." So, they are not responsible for canceling a trip?? Who is then?? And how can I get my money back?Not to mention that they didn\'t bother to let me know the trip was cancelled both ways. They confirmed the return trip and only by calling them the day before I found out this was canceled too, no one from Flixbus bothered to let me know I actually payed for nothing.So, as long as I don\'t have any conversation partner, they take no responsibility for canceling bookings I payed for and I don\'t see any money back, I call this thievery. They just stole my money at this moment.Dear travelers, please stay away from Flixbus - don\'t put your money in it. You risk to pay for nothing other than calls to customer service for trips that are not happening. You risk your nerves and putting yourself in the situation of quickly finding a more expensive way to get to your destination. They are not reliable, there\'s no responsible person to talk to (call center people are ok but they have no ways and no power to help).Avoid FLIXBUS!!!

{'review': 'I booked with Flixbus for an overnight service from Karlsruhe to Prague because it was the only direct bus on that day departing late enough for me to catch at the end of a business trip. Booking went smoothly, I got several confirmations by e-mail, the latest one at the morning of tdeparture. However, approximately two hours before the planned departure, I received an SMS informing me (with a very formal apology) that the bus was cancelled, that I have been transferred to an alternative route and that all additional information has been sent to me by e-mail. Since I do not own a smartphone, I had no way to access my e-mail, so I had to phone the non-stop service line of Flixbus. It took two attempts to be connected to a (very polite!) English-speaking assistant, and then some effort to persuade her that repeated sending of the e-mail won¬¥t help me and that I really need at least the time of departure, service No and, most importantly, my individual code over the phone. Why couldn¬¥t they send this information in the original SMS??Moreover, itr turned out that the alternate route involves an almost two hours stopover at Frankfurt in the middle of the night (departure 00.15). The bus was late for both parts of the journey - approx. an hour for the first (there I at least got an SMS announcing a 40 min delay due to heavy traffic) and about half an hour for the second (no info from the company) .Both in Karlsruhe and in Frankfurt the boarding took place (and the travellers had to wait!) at a place that fell deep below the standards of a small town bus stop e.g. of the 1980ies Czechoslovakia , which at least usually had a shelter, something to sit on, and a public toilet, or at least some useable bushes  nearby. The toilet of the Karlsruhe bus station was out of service, and walking the 600m to the closet loo at the Frankfurt main station before midnight through a building site frequented by some shadowy figures was not a pleasant experience!. Green busses seemed to be coming at random times and stopping at random places, resulting in the crowd of passengers running around (with all luggage) to find out whether this happens to be their connection. I do not wish to imagine what would the place look like in continuous heavy rain!While the ride itself was OK, I would have been more than happy to pay more in exchange for a better service at stops. At least in Frankfurt it would perhaps be worth investing into an info-screen in the window of the Flixbus office at the bus stop to announce incoming buses.  I also frankly do not understand why FlixBus decided that people who are not all the time online deserve to be treated as second class citizens.', 'stars': '1'}

They seem to have completely forgotten that the people they transport are CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES! They sometimes try to make a few jokes at the beginning of the travel but good luck understanding it\'s only in German. This "sympathy" doesn\'t compensate their rudeness at all in my opinion. - Don\'t put any fragile items in you bag going in the lock it will be (every time) thrown literally on the floor and in/off the lock as a piece of garbage in the trash - and they\'re very likely to throw bags on top of yours. - I write this as we just went out for a 5min break and in the middle of the break someone was walking a bit too far for the driver\'s (or should I say Kommandant?!) taste. The driver went completely mad and shouted at him to come back (I guess, German again...) and cancelled the break for everyone shouting all passengers to get back on the bus. "no brain, no break" ("kein kopf" that\'s all I understood with my bad German level) - And last but not least... Don\'t forget your ID it\'s been twice now I see people getting denied the access to the bus. Story#1: Tears, shouting, familiy stuck at the Paris bus station at 9pm with no care, rudeness, and no compassion whatsoever. No solution offered for them either for where to spend the night, they are left on the street just because one person amongst 6 have no proper ID?! But they have loads of papers, they paid their tickets, they have small babies, they look totally desperate and the only thing you find is to shout at them in German and a few English words?! "NO PASSPORT NO BUS!".... Honestly after that you leave and make jokes? Personally as a passenger I feel awful and disgusted to be in this bus, leaving Paris with a family in tears on the parking. Story#2: leaving Berlin this time. They made a woman cry again. She is pregnant and she has a ticket but apparently not the right ID?! It last about 15 minutes of shouting at her and her crying. Everyone is kind of boarding, she\'s going to be left in the evening at the bus station. Fortunately a girl speaking German starts being on her side and shout at the driv-Kommandant and they all finally realised that she - as a EU citizen - has the right to travel in this bus and her ID papers are enough.

We waited for 1.5 hours and when the bus finally did show up the driver very rudely told everyone that the bus wouldn't leave till 5:30. I didn't receive any text or update from Flixbus till 5 pm, so late so we had no idea what was going on. There is absolutely no info or customer service available. The bus was 1.5  late arriving as well. Horrible service, unreliable buses, save your money and time and book other services like Ouibus that are on time and the bus drivers aren't rude and flippant.

{'review': "I'm taking the time to write this review while on vacation. I hope it helps prevent others from going through the same horrible experience that I went through with Flixbus.It all began on a Monday, when my wife and I missed our bus. The Paris Flixbus depot is just a make shift parking lot with no numbers, no announcements, the only thing around are a bunch of people aimlessly wandering around looking for their bus like a zombie apocalypse. Anyways, We miss the bus because we couldn't figure out where the bus was.  We go to the little temporary shed/booth that's 20 meters from the entrance and tell the attendant our situation. She tells us the only thing we can do is call customer service. We call customer service. They explain to us that there is nothing they can do with their system and that if we want to rebook we need to e-mail.We e-mail. We receive an e-mail back an hour later, in the fine print it states that it may take several days for them to review our e-mail. After reading that we called back and had to demand to speak to a manager and tell them that we needed to rebook for the next bus (which was the next day). The manager hooked us up with a voucher for 89.00 euro (our tickets were 120.00 euro, but thats fine). We get our ticket.THE NEXT DAY ON THE N100 TO BERLIN...June.5th Monday 2017 21:00.  We make sure this time to run around the parking lot checking every single bus that pulls in and out. Our bus gets in and about 50 people run up to it. There's no line up, no organization. Just the bus driver yelling at everyone in German. We it comes to our turn the bus driver screams at us about the painting we have with us (which is in cardboard) It was 24X30X2 inches. We didn't understand what he was screaming was that we weren't allowed to bring it with us. We offered to pay extra and he REFUSED that it comes with us. I observed a bicyles, a guitar case, and other odd thing but our painting wasn't allowed for some reason. After both my wife and I beg and pled we finally asked if the painting was removed from the frame if it could come (there was no glass btw, very simple wood frame). He kind of nodded his head. So we remove the frame. At this point every one is on the bus with their luggage. He looks at the canvas and scoffs saying it's still not good enough. He gets on the bus, now our luggage was on board too underneath everyone else so the driver didn't want to get our luggage. He was going to drive off with it. A woman handed us a knife and we had to cut out painting off the wood on its back and roll it up. My wife was crying as she watched me be forced to destroy our painting. (Her deceased family member painted it in the 1930's)Everyone was on the bus watching in horror, a few people asked the driver to just let us bring our painting. He didn't care. When we finally got to Berlin as people got off the bus they started to get their own luggage. The driver yelled some more and started LEGIT throwing peoples bags off the bus. Completely horrible customer service. No compassion or humanity. The whole thing felt comparable to a scene out of a jail movie.", 'stars': '1'}

Then I showed the driver my passport copy combined with my ID card. He still not allowed me onboarding the bus. He said "For you it is not okey."

I arrived half an hour before the scheduled departure from Munich to Berlin (12.45am) but after waiting for more than 1.5 hours, the bus never docked at the scheduled berth. When I called the English Customer Service Hotline at 1.40am, the officer informed me that the bus had broken down and advised me to take a train to Berlin instead, for which the cost of the train ticket (146 euros) will be reimbursed. I called in a second time at 2.30am and the same customer service lady assured me that the train ticket will be reimbursed. When I emailed a copy of my train ticket to the customer service mailbox, the response I received was that "there was no such breakdown" and "sorry no refund". When I called in to clarify and ask for a copy of the phone recordings, the only answer I received from the other line was "sorry I can\'t help", "the other passengers boarded the bus" and "please email in your request". I was stranded with the other passengers at 2am in the morning and have sent in a total of 4 emails but the company is simply denying compensation and denying that the phone communication took place. I am 110% certain that the bus did not dock at the scheduled berth and that there were other passengers who did not board the bus that morning because I was with them. Even if I had missed the bus, the customer service officer should have said so and not "advise" me to take the train, only to deny compensation later. In my subsequent calls and emails to Flixbus customer service, their wonderful customer service responded to me with "why didn\'t you board the bus!", "like we said.....", "other passengers boarded the bus...". What they intentionally omitted/denied was the number of passengers who did not board the bus from Munich ZOB and the phone conversation with the customer service lady who informed me of a "breakdown" and the advice to take the train.

De Duitse chauffeur kwam nors en onge√Ønteresseerd over, er kon geen goedemorgen van af en daarnaast reed hij ook nog eens de verkeerde route (richting Almere in plaats van Arnhem).. Hierdoor liepen we vertraging op. De wc stonk met vlagen behoorlijk naar urine, erg vies. Bus was verder netjes, wel weinig beenruimte als je lang bent!Toen we haastig wat gingen eten voordat we de bus weer terug zouden pakken aan het einde van de dag, ontving ik ineens een sms bericht dat de bus 45 minuten vertraging had. Een uitleg waarom precies kregen we niet. Erg vervelend als je een dagje een stad bezoekt en je dus wat langer had kunnen blijven. Op het busstation waren trouwens echt te weinig bankjes als je lang moet zitten wachten en er hingen hier en daar zwervers en vage dronken mensen rond. Niet echt fijn.Op de weg terug hadden we weer een erg afstandelijke Duitse chauffeur die er weinig zin in leek te hebben. Onderweg besloot hij te tanken (want ja ach we hadden toch al immers vertraging). Hij pakte iets uit een kastje en ik hoorde hem vloeken. Maar liefst een uur later kwamen we weer op station Amsterdam Sloterdijk aan. De volgende keer zal ik  liever wat meer willen betalen dan ooit nog met de trage en onvriendelijke FlixBus te gaan. Op papier en sociale media presenteren ze zich als een enthousiaste organisatie, maar vergeet het maar zodra je de reis daadwerkelijk ondergaat. Ik zou de organisatie zeker afraden voor langere stukken!* English: FlixBus is only recommended for short trips. The service is awful. Driver took the wrong direction wich caused a delay of 20 minutes. On our way back we had to wait 45 minutes on the busstop in D√ºsseldorf without any seats on the station. Thank God the sun was shining. The toilet smelled very badly of urine in the bus, the drivers seemed depressed and tired of life (no greetings, no care for the passengers, no announcent why they were late, swearing, etc ).

There was no information available on the website about the delays, me along with other passengers had to wait in Essen for more than 1 hour from 21 25 while it was raining heavy! During my onward journey the bus was coming all the way from London but on the way back it started from Dortmund. There is no justification for such delay. While I arrived at Eindhoven, I was the only passenger to get down to the door through the rear stairs, and they were not opening the rear door. There was a blockade created by the staff by stretching out the seat belts across the isle. I tried to call the non-driving staff who was in the front and he did not hear me. I stepped over the blockade and reached to front. Finding me behind him, this guy turned furious - asking how did I get there. I explained to him that I couldn't make myself heard and I stepped over the blockade.  Then this guy started yelling at me to go back at the top of his voice, and even pushed me to go back and back step over the blockade  and go out through the rear door as if I was travelling illegally or without paying. While others who went down through the stairs in front were getting out of the bus and wondering why I am not let through but shooed and shoved to the back. It was late at night 12.40 am, I was sleepy and exhausted and drenched in the rain by waiting for an hour at the bus stop at Essen and this is how I got treated as a paying customer!. Never again with Flixbus and I have shared my experience within the travel community where I was suggested Flixbus as a cheaper alternative to DB. Please train your staff on the basics of a polite interaction if you can't make them to keep time. Goodbye Flixbus.", 'stars': '1'}

It got delayed by 7 hrs and I got a message about a free travel coupon by flixbus. Which I have not yet received. This is a different issue but more importantly please read what happened that night.I must say this was a nightmare journey for me and all other passengers. I would briefly tell what happened:1. The bus was at 9.05 pm in the night. First we got a message that bus will be delayed by one hr. That was fine. Then after an hour we got message that delayed by 3.hrs. Then after another 2 hrs we got message that delayed by 4hrs 40mts, then got message that delayed by 6hrs 40mts and then got message that delayed by 6 hrs 55mts. So everyone lost patience, children of passengers crying etc. Can a bus get delayed by 7 hrs? Shouldn't have a new bus been arranged in this time?2. There was no provision for passengers stay arranged during this delay time. It was our luck that the pickup point was airport, so we got in and could somehow manage this time. Think of it was in some remote place or think of someone who is getting in from a remote pick up point.3. Heater not working in bus. Though it is April, but still at night it was cold enough and we required heater, but it was not working. 4. Toilet out of order in bus. Imagine people waiting whole night for the bus and then the heater not working and on top of it toilets also out of order. We were not able to use toilets till 12 noon, till we reached the checkpoint. I had office urgent meetings and had a bad face in office. I Had to apply for leave.

{'review': "Worst journey I've ever had, considering it was my first ever coach trip. From the beginning the bus arrived two hours late to Victoria and before we even took off we were informed the toilet were not in operation considering it was a 12 hour journey. The driver didn't seem to know the way out of central London so we spent near to an hour going around in circles until a passenger took it upon themselves to direct him. When we finally got towards the channel tunnel, the driver adviced us all to take a 15 minutes break but he decided to disappear and take a break for up to an hour leaving us all standing outside the coach looking like idiots and this caused us to miss our crossing towards France.No apologies were given and the driver didn't appear to give a s***t quite frankly. When we finally got to France, the driver took so long to exit the ferry train that we were shut in which caused us to be even more delayed. Enroute in France the driver decided to divert down a country road and to our shock he decided to drop a passenger off in front of their house claiming the lady had kids. When passengers decided to confront him about the situation he got on the microphone and blamed us all for the situation even though there was no form of communication from him at all. Over four hours in France and when a passenger asked if we could stop at the nearest service station the driver replied and announced in an unprofessional manner that we can all get off and use the toilet and if we want we can sleep in the toilets as he's got all day to spend. It is now 21:02 and so far we've been on this 12 hours journey for over 10 hours and we're not even half way yet. The service today has been absolutely appalling and if I could rate it below a one star I would. Every passenger on the bus feels the same way and as we've been treated like we were on a free ride, I would like to request all my money back as the service we've received today has not amount to the payment we've all made for this journey.

I didn‚Äôt made a good planning of my trip. The bus was late but the delay below 120 min is normal for Flixbus. And of course no attention or reimbursement from Flixbus, I reached my destination and I am very satisfied with this performance. I wil share this experience on all sites to thank you,  Flixbux,  for my trip. That's why you must carefully choose your bus, before trip you verify bus tyres because the driver have other very important things to do and there is not responsibility for your lost flight (like talking with other flixbus driver about holidays and all flixbus clients waiting him about 10 minutes to finish conversation) . I think if Flixbus don't care about security and client connections during their trips, I sent a mail like this to customers service, but they considered my arguments not important, ignored my message and didn‚Äôt answered, that‚Äôs why I think I can post my message everywhere to inform potentially victims. I think that after 5-6 messages like this from different clients, they will try to do better, at least to stop ignoring clients messages considering there is a problem.I have nothing with Flixbus, I simply hate persons that don‚Äôt know their job and don‚Äôt care about clients‚Äô needs. You like take money, but you don‚Äôt like to accomplish your engagements. I‚Äôm sure you will write that it was an exceptional situation and the driver done very well its job because we haven‚Äôt got news on TV about this bus, but it‚Äôs not a normal estimation of a situation for normal peoples. Thank you for the answer, it was a good try.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "I arrived at the Victoria coach station at least 15 mins before my journey departure time 21:30 (13/05/17). CCTV footage would actually prove this. I had time to stop at the shop to buy sweets for my overnight journey to Amsterdam.When I arrived at the departure gate there was a crowd of people already there. The coach for Amsterdam was sitting there with the driver in his seat. I thought it strange that passengers were not boarding so I waited and waited. There was no last call, or indication that they were still boarding. Obviously the driver has a list of passengers with my name NOT ticked off. But no announcement. The coach was dark so I could not see any passengers on board. Then the coach left.If they were still boarding why was the driver sitting in the coach, doing nothing for that whole time I was waiting, with no one to indicate boarding? I have been calling Flixbus customer service in Germany and France all night until I was told to call and speak to a Manager in the morning. In the morning no Manager or Supervisor was willing to speak with me. They were very rude and simply insisted that their bus was on time. What is the point of being on time if your driver is sitting at the wheel? This incident can be proved by CCTV footage at the station but they don't seem to care... Everything they do in online, they have no physical representation at the Coach station. Maybe the driver was online as well?So here I am now still in London, when I should be in Amsterdam this morning. I had to book accommodation for the night. So I intend to take National Express tonight. They have a customer service that is accessible in UK and elsewhere.I finally continued my journey with Eurolines and felt much safer, comfortable and reassured. Especially since they have physical representatives in place throughout most of Europe as well as speedy online and phone response. It's not so easy dealing with companies that are only online and have no real reps as everything feels up in the air as it did with Flixbus and more so its highly unlikely that such virtual companies would take responsibility for their actions or lack of.", 'stars': '1'}

This has led us to call on him to let him know that we are still inside which made him scream at us using unpleasant tone / words and factually threw us 150 meters after the initial stop and immediately continue his way keeping our luggage with him.

I booked it only under that condition and on their homepage they sell it like you can always take it with you. You have to book it extra though. Wanted to make it over email, since their hotline is a foreign number for me and expensive. Send them my request with booking number but got referred to the hotline.Called the hotline, 6min long, stupid and non helpful call! First I was told I would not be able to take my extra luggage with me because on that trip they are using a double-decker bus with cannot carry that (why not? and why do you even sell it on the website as if you could book extra luggage on every single bus) and then the lady was not able to help me further in any way nor able to refer me to a person that could maybe help me/knows more/has more responsibility. Instead she referred me back to the service email.... where I had just written a message before and waited for FOUR days for a response, referring me to the hotline...Do not make promises you cannot hold and have better ways of communication!!!!!Note: got a very fast reply this time just saying there is nothing they can do about it.Flixbus was ACTIVELY selling it as something like "go skiing, take your skiers with you and travel by Flixbus"- got that in an marketing email - SORRY but that is hilarious. You cannot use it for marketing purposes if you cannot live up for it!And on the internet they sell it with these words: "The advantages of taking FlixBus to go skiing‚úî During winter, FlixBus offers bus services especially for skiers, snowboarders and other snow fans.‚úî Frequent departures to the Alps and the Pyrenees from Paris and Lyon.‚úî Modern and comfortable buses equipped with Wi-Fi and electrical outlets.‚úî With three pieces of luggage included, you will have room for all your ski gear." Ewwww, screw you - there are NO advantages...One customer less FOR SURE!And what is very disturbing, when I am reading older reviews, this is not the first time happening! After it had happened once you should consider your service and policies! Instead of just replying sorry for the inconviencen e but we hope to see you soon again on one of our buses... probably not.Stop just answering in a generic way and actually DO something about your customer service!', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Everything was fine, not to say perfect. FlixBus Removed all my prejudice and I will definitely use FlixBus again.BUTWhile the bus passed the state of Thuringia police diverted the bus from the Highway to a "remote" hall. They made a short announcement that all passengers had to hand out a piece of identification (ID, passport or drivers license) take everything - EVERYTHING -  with them and leave the bus. There we stood in the hall and a bunch of police selected particular passengers to be searched, while the others were guarded by other police. They searched the bus with  police dog.and they only picked out young men with possible foreign background. The search was conducted unprofessional, it\'s as if police had no time to prepare the search. The narrative was that police searched for dangerous items.They found nothing. One passenger was searched twice, most not at all. They searched six or seven passengers of a total of some 35, while the others were left alone. I\'m a non smoker, but I took a piece of missconduct against smokers to complain and they finally allowed the smokers to have a cigarette and they explained the legal foundation for that search to me as I had persistently asked, but to nobody else.  And this was the actual missconduct. They said, they would search, but they didn\'t explain their legality.We arrived in Berlin two hours late. Public transportation was out of service at that time. Only a night bus was coming now and then but we had t ask at a nearby hotel where the receptionist directed us to the bus stop.I would have appreciated, if FlixBus had provided us some information after that delay. With these two thing together I got to bed at 05:00 AM instead of 02:00 AM. This may not be an issue for a young person, but I\'m no longer young.', 'stars': '3'}

{'review': "Let me start this review by pointing out that Flixbus advertise themselves during the winter months as an easy and cheap way to get to the Alps or other skiing/snowboarding destinations. I can unequivocally say that if you plan to do this, and also plan to bring your own skis/snowboards, you're fresh out of luck. While it is true that Flixbus have provisions for taking oversized luggage (at a cost of 9 EUR per item), you are not guaranteed to be able to put this luggage on the bus. The real problem lies in the fact that passengers are only able to find out if they can take their oversized luggage or not 48 hours before departure, at the EARLIEST. Imagine our surprise when we called Flixbus (as is the procedure), the day before we were due to leave, only to find out that due to the fact it was a double decker bus, we would be unable to bring our snowboarding equipment.This then set in motion a sequence of communications between myself and Flixbus in order for me to get a refund for the trip, which all told took over 2 months. Flixbus' customer service agents were mostly agreeable and polite, although some were flat out rude. And despite trying on multiple occasions I never managed to get a supervisor on the phone. The way in which Flixbus handled my case for refund was unacceptable. I was forced to chase up my case on multiple occasions, as it is impossible to get the finance department on the phone. The case was dragged out by the fact that Flixbus only refunded me half the trip after I was explicitly told I would get the whole trip refunded. This then forced me to go through the whole process again, which took even longer the second time. In the end they refunded me the whole trip, but as it was two different cases one after the other, they charged me the service fee twice, which I find absolutely ridiculous. To sum up, Flixbus has terrible customer service (politeness aside), and ridiculous terms and conditions. If their goal is to lose customers, they have certainly succeeded. I will never use Flixbus again, nor would I recommend Flixbus to anyone at all.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Last night 23-01-17, all the passengers on N710 signed a petition.The bus was more than 3hrs late, and the EU directive 181/2011, states that above 120mins late, the company is in a legal OBLIGATION to provide food and drink.In this case the weather was extremely cold, and the attitude of the company was simply from unsympathetic to downright cavalier.(They even insisted we would have to PAY for cold not HOT drinks!)This petition will go to the EU commission with a request for the suspension of Flixbus\' operating licence.It is also being sent to the regional newspapers, the directors of Flixbus and a number of important organisations which are intended to police operations, and make sure consumer abuses like this, do not become  widespread.I wasted the remains of the money on my mobile calling them to explain what is meant by providing REAL, not VIRTUAL help on the day, arguing they would need to organise hot food for the entire passenger list, in LYON, including those that had been standing in temperatures down to -5C for up to 4hrs. They just stonewalled me, promising all kinds of other things such as free tickets, which did not interest me.I imagine of course I will never get that money back, just like the hotel reservation I wasted and the extra car parking charges at my destination. The following day of course, I could hardly say I am fit to do any work either!The best expressions remain WHAT IF? and of course W-T-F?Last week\'s trip to Frankfurt was ALSO 1hr late, which was a disaster on its own with no wifi access thrown in for fun!They haven\'t yet made any proposal to pay for the damage on that 1 week later, so why should we imagine this is any better?One has to begin to realise this company is operating in a speculative and new online virtual office orientated experimental way.It owns no buses, sub contracts and sub leases in an aggressive marketing fashion in order to construct yet another pyramidic internet marketed sales cartel, and the miserable reality is no more than flashy web sites and buses, with corporate buy-outs like megabus to break into areas in which they have no presence or competence.Last night\'s nightmare was propelled by the obvious illogicality of having a German bus replaced at a distance of more than 1500kms, because that particular line is operated this way from Cologne.Go figure! It\'s an obvious single point of failure which a child of 10 could work out.In this sorry conclusion, they clearly have not the slightest idea of what is meant by the EU directives, no desire to improve, and are quite happy to operate fully illegally, so long as they don\'t get caught out or have a serious accident, with maybe hypothermia on the menu served up cold.When you look at the way conflict management, communication, and bus breakdown are handled, you realise Flixbus is a "fly by night" transport company "LITE", which simply has no strategy or backup when things go wrong. These incidents are bound to happen on flixbus, 22-24hr long distance under insured bus trips, for the simple reason, buses don\'t run on rails, and bla-bla is insured by AXA, who DO handle things properly.(I had first hand experience of AXA-Bla-bla, and although a little slow IT WORKED, and the promised hotel/car recovery all worked).On the site of Flix by contrast, none of the promised bollox on their web site ever becomes reality.The basic name of the game is:-"if it sounds too good to be true, then it usually IS".That is Flixbus for you, and until such time they improve, they would have to pay me to use their buses, not the other way around.---I read your thoroughly dishonest and disingenuous answer with great interest.It\'s typical of the cynical way an organisation like yours functions.There is an elephant in the room and you are in absolute denial.It\'s quite disgusting to read, and your bus departed 3h20 late.Let me quote you:-"Your bus was due to depart at 16:40 o\'clock. We had already informed you about a delay of 150 minutes right in the morning at 10:44 o\'clock. It\'s also not true that it was neccessary to stay at the station and freeze there.At 15:43, which is still well ahead of the time that your bus would come with the delay, we informed you eventually that your bus was 3 hours and 5 minutes late."Let\'s get this straight.None of us actually give a damn of your "informing us".People at least sensible ones usually come to a bus stop BEFORE TIME.They also usually make their plans for the day, around the schedule for which you are taking money off them.Here is the "elephant in the room"!>What are we supposed to do?<It PROVES you are in denial!Another Eg.One of the really really angry guys standing in Montpellier had just taken one of your buses from Marseille, which would have ended up being a good connecting service.He is going to wait where? He has come from Marseille and then is forced to stand around with nowhere to go for anything up to 4h!Please can you tell me? Where is this mysterious planet customers left in the lurch are supposed to land on where we are not FORCED to wait for the connecting service? Does it exist on earth, or you stuck in front of your stupid virtual reality staring at dots on a screen, instead of imagining how it is to be stranded outside Lyon railway station in the freezing dark, where YOU AS A COMPANY don\'t have a waiting room.You have NO OFFICE anywhere, Eurolines do, Isilines do.YOU? ZILCH,  because you are a "fly by night" organisation, that does not believe in any concept of customer service.As for me, I came in on a regional local bus in time for lunchtime, it was warm in daylight hours.In winter months when the sun goes down it\'s freezing.You think I have never taken a long distance bus before?In the Baltic states, and as far as St Petersburg, places I travel in all the time,in the harshest possible weather,all times of the day and night, I have never ever seen a shambles even remotely resembling what you have managed in the last 2 weeks.Not ONCE, but TWICE.If you are not intent on insulting our intelligence, tell me exactly WHERE we are supposed to wait?Tell me how people are supposed to get home in some place like Dijon, when you dump them in the freezing cold hours after public transport has stopped for the night and all stations are closed and locked.One of the passengers who left me his E-mail last night had to walk home 1 1/2 hrs  at -6C directly because of your total shambles.He is reading this all with great interest!TBH your answer demonstrates such an irresponsible attitude of cynicism, I actually believe you are setting out to "wind customers up".All you want is to advertise so heavily, getting fresh suckers into your buses so quickly, that customer loyalty basically doesn\'t matter to you any more.If in fact you were so smart and correct, tell me why all the passengers on the bus signed a petition to bring you back down to earth?Believe me, with this behaviour you won\'t go far.I will make it my job, to ensure someone in authority looks very seriously into your company and makes a serious audit of all your malpractice.', 'stars': '1'}

I never got my money back from Flixbus.Although it is cheap, if you need to hurry, you might lose lots of time and money.. and miss your appointments.I will travel by trains in the future', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'So, I had my first and last experience with Flixbus going from Lund - Stockholm.First of all, the bus was 50 minutes late and I had to wait out in the dark, cold, Swedish winter during ~1hr before the bus arrived. I was notified that the bus was going to be "a few minutes late" only 15 minutes before the departure time. Then I called customer service and they informed me it was actually 15 minutes late.After waiting and the 15-minute mark passed I called back and now I got to talk to another representative who informed me that the bus was in fact going to be 50 minutes late. How it became 35 minutes later only 25 minutes after my first call is a mystery to me. So, since I didn\'t trust her I asked for the geographical location of the bus, so at least I could make my own estimate. She said it was impossible for her to say and that there\'s no use that we keep talking about it and then she hung up on me. I froze for 1 hour before the bus came.The bus itself did not have comfortable seats. The seats are actually less comfortable than those of the normal city buses in Lund, but they do recline. There was no space for me to put my carry-on luggage as I was sitting in the front and there were other stuff above me, so my carry-on had to go with the other luggage under the bus.The bus toilet was out of toilet paper and the driver informed us that there was no way for him to refill it until we would have a break after 4 more hours.As you can imagine, I\'m never again using Flixbus and I\'m telling all my friends to avoid this company.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "We have bought two tickets go and come back from Paris to Innsbruck. Main aim of the trip was skiing. On official website it is written that we can take bulky luggage, just need to call not earlier that 48 hours in advance. So, 48 hours in advance i call them and they say  - NO, you can not take your snowboard, there is no place. - Ok, then what solution you can propose? - To exchange the date of the tickets! - But we have already accommodation booked and paid! Ok, may be one of us exchange the date of ticket, but be able to take ski equipment. - You have to pay 25 euros extra for exchange because of difference in price. - Ok...Then i asked how do we do to return. And answer was - NO WAY! Because they have only double-decker buses that can not at all take ski equipment!We were very angry that woman in call center did not tell us this before. She knew, but didn't tell! So, we can not take ski equipment at all in Flixbus, there is no way, we pay extra to travel separately and it was absolutely useless. Than we wanted to come back just to initial booking to travel, ok, without equipment, but at least together. And.. we had to pay 20 euros more for this!!!Finally, we took the bus, bus itself is ok, not bad, with wifi and toilet. Drivers are brutal, area to wait the bus is outside (in cold) and there is no indication at all. The only good thing about this company - tickets are cheap (if you buy in advance).", 'stars': '1'}

"It says on the wall here in the bus station that you have to have your passport." I mean, come on. How would I know if I had never been to your bus station before? The guy at the check-in point even said "Ask the bus driver. If he will let you go, I will give you the boarding pass." Then the bus driver insisted that Hungary is not a Schengen country.

The bus was 15-20min late and then the bus driver would not let us board. We had a ticket for the first portion and second.

So ¬£150 on pointless coaches. And to top it all off I contacted Flix Bus with my complaint, who palmed me off with an apology! How do you think an apology is acceptable for me having to do 24 hours travel for no reason as your driver couldn't stick to his timing. Disgraceful company do not ever use and I will be contacting London Travel Watch for an independent review of my complaint, seeing as all Flix bus want to do is palm me off with were sorry please give us a feedback review.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "It seems bizarre that you guys receive so many negative opinions and all you can say that you apologize. It's not even about wasting time and money, it is about showing respect to your customer.I traveled from Cologne to Bordeaux with a transfer in Paris.The bus came in Cologne 1.5hrs late, without any information. I was standing in the rain with my luggage at 11 p.m. in a foreign country. When the bus arrived there was no Wi-fi or WC.When I got to Paris my bus just left without me, so Flixbus services told me to buy a train ticket and I will get a refound since I HAD to be on time in Bordeaux. I did it, Lost around 130‚Ç¨,  because Flixbus told me that I could take a later bus, which I couldn't.You guys don't care about your customers and their priorities. Defenietly not reliable. After complaining I got an information I can receive a refound worth 19‚Ç¨ which I spent 150‚Ç¨ total on this trip, once again because of FLIXBUS. I had to email the company again to make sure I will even get that money back, which I shouldn't keep remaining you guys about customers rights.I wasn't late for any of my trip, it's clearly company's fault.I feel like you guys treat your customers as a joke and I defenietly do not deserve it.

{'review': 'I was travelling from Strassbourgh to Frankfurt airport from where I was supposed to fly to Denmark. I had been told that delays can occur with flixbus so I booked a ticket where I was schedualed to arrive 4:30 hours before my flight - that would give me some extra hours incase of delays. I had to change bus in Karlsruhe and on my first bus I received to text messages from flixbus where they stated that they were 1 hour delayed. Fair enough I thought. Turned out they were more than 2:30 hours late. So I was waiting for my next bus without hearing anything from flixbus, and without any of the many flixbus drivers who arrived and departed while I was waiting was able to help me. Finally amother bus goimg to Berlin but passing through Frankfurt airport arrived. I was relieved, only to find out that they wouldnt let me get on that bus because I only had ticket for another bus. This bus, going to Berlin, was half empty and I would have made it to Frankfurt in time to catch my flight if they would have let me take that bus. But no, I was shocked to find out that they wouldnt let me take that bus (both busses being flixbus). I asked if I could pay for a new ticket there for the bus going to Berlin, but I didmt have cash and the driver didnt want to wait for me buying a new ticket online. He just roled his eyes and assured me that my own bus was coming 30 minutes later. It didnt. It came more than 1 hour later and I missed my fligh. I dont wish a flixbus ride for my worst enemy - stay away everyone. Pay the little extra for a decent company who doesnt screw you over, thats at least my advice.', 'stars': '1'}

However, it's absolutely wrong, as I have personally heard how drivers have been called by Flixbus employees to know why they are late and when will they arrive. It seems that it could be better that I have just forgotten it somewhere on the street and someone would call me as there is my contact information there. It doesnt matter which level of comany Fluxbus, even if it is young brand, it's just basics human politeness understanding that belongings of others are not rubbish.

I have a strong belief that the driver now stole my bags.I have written a complaint and been in touch with the customer center for the last 21 days and they say that they are still checking.I am in England without my luggage in a new country and they have little concern for customer and in general no feeling of sufferings of HUMAN BEINGS.They just don't communicate and don't care of the problems done by their company to others. they have no respect.I am not going to keep quiet for this because my luggage was all what I have in my life.

{'review': 'Earlier this week I had a harrowing experience with one of your drivers at the Paris, Porte Maillot Station, Route 802 direction Amsterdam Sloterdijk, 2:30 PM departure. I had booked a round trip ticket from Ghent Belgium to Paris from Friday to Sunday and had a very positive first experience riding with Flix Bus on my way to Paris, however today I experienced the most traumatic, embarrassing, and stressful travel experiences of my life because of your driver\'s refusal to allow me on board. I currently live in Belgium, but am an American citizen. Last week I misplaced my passport while visiting a friend (which will be recovered later this week), however this caused me to travel to Paris this week without a passport. To be safe I registered my travel with the U.S. Embassies in France and Belgium, and called Flixbus to find out what their passport policy is. His justification, "My bus, my rules." I asked if at the very least, understanding his concerns about crossing the border, if I could ride the bus as far as Lille, where I could take a reduced fare back to Ghent, without having to pay the full price of a unplanned train ticket back to Belgium. He assured me that by stranding me in Paris, he was teaching me a lesson that I won\'t soon forget. I then spoke with the security at the bus station, explained the situation, showed my credentials, and they decided it was up to the driver\'s desecration whether or not to let me on board. As you can guess, he abruptly shut the door to the bus and very aggressively pulled out of the station, leaving me in an unfamiliar city and without any clear way to get home.I spoke with the Porte Maillot station agent who offered a half-hearted apology and a 5 euro voucher for the "inconvenience." She then suggested, "You\'re better off taking the train." So after suffering a panic attack I recovered enough to endure a harrowing two hours of wandering the streets of Paris and getting off at a series of wrong Metro stops, I eventually made it to Gare du Nord, where I had to pay 76 euro for a one way ticket from Paris to Brussels, and an additional 10 euro to connect from Brussels to Ghent. Essentially to make it home safely, I had to pay more than I did during my entire weekend in Paris, plus endure the stress and anxiety that comes with not knowing when or how I would make it back.So if you would like to be publicly shamed and humiliated and left without any clear way how to get home, this is the travel service for you!

Actually he didn't say anything, when I showed him my ID, he just turned away and called for the next person.

He didn't even check her passport! whether it was up to date or even under her name, he didn't care. Here I was with legit ID and he didn't let me on. so I was left there all along, in a different country without a language and no clue of what am I supposed to be doing.. I went to the train station and asked them If I could go back to germany with Aufenthaltstitel and they said of course I could and whereever have I heard that I couldn't...

{'review': 'I have been traveling with this company several times, I guess around six or eight. Only in one of those trips WiFi was actually working. Why do you advertise WiFi if it is in fact not functioning? I guess I should turn to customer protection authorities cause company is giving false information about their services. Secondly, three journeys were delayed, last one for 30 minutes. Thus I missed very important appointment. I am perfectly aware that there are traffic jams etc, but then you must warn travelers that bus departure/arrival times are only indicative and not reliable. This is another reason to complain to customer protection authorities. Indicate realistic arrival and departure times. Moreover, why all the journeys are planned through the middle of major cities which will almost always lead to delays because of traffic jams? Remember that the traffic jams cannot be claimed as force majeure because you can reasonably predict these circumstances and avoid them by re-planing your routes which leads to that customers can ask refund for every delay unless there is a hurricane or circumstances like this. Unreachable customer service is another story. When you call, you "hang" on the line for more than ten minutes and then you just let go and stop trying to call. Each such call costs a lot of money. Who is going to refund me that? And I really needed to contact customer service because I must book my foldable bicycle. However, nobody picked up the phone and nobody replied to my already two emails so I do not know can I or can I not take my bike with me. It is also not possible to book the bicycle when purchasing tickets because system says that there are no slots for bicycle transportation, please contact our customer service and blah blah. Do you have like three employees there? It is indeed the last time I will use this company and will certainly not recommend it to anyone else, actually quite opposite.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'Booked a bus from Bozen/Bolzano (Hotel Alpi) to Milan (Lampugna bus station). Bus departure was delayed ~45 minutes, while arrival at the destination was delayed ~120 minutes. Being so late obviously makes me miss my connecting train (which had a 50 minute buffer from expected arrival) and forced me to take a taxi to the airport, at the costly price of 92 EUR (fortunately shared with two Italians who were even later for their plane). I made the gate only 8 minutes before it closed, after what had been a stressful trip through the airport to say the least.I subsequently wrote their customer service a polite, yet very dissatisfied, complaint (in English), asking them to at least compensate the extra cost they incurred. Their reply took just short of a month, and they decided German would be the appropriate language to reply in.Google Translate can then inform me that "we apologize for you", but "delays have events the cause of which we have no influence, despite the utmost care and the best possible preparations." In this case they claim force majeure and do not hold themselves responsible for the excessive delay. There was no further information on what caused the delay, why it was unavoidable on their part, nor why it was not within their power to uphold their contract to inform passengers of delays over 15 minutes. They have both my email and my mobile phone number, none of which received any notification.All in all, an extremely dissatisfactory trip and an equally dissatisfactory handling of the following complaint. Don\'t expect FlixBus to hold their schedule, inform you of delays, or even take the time to explain these "events the cause of which we have no influence".FlixBus "hope soon to be able to convince you of our reliability again". I find that very unlikely, as you don\'t even have the decency to explain your circumstances before excusing yourselves and refusing the responsibility.I hope the Italians made their plane.', 'stars': '1'}

We did take a bus this summer from Zagreb to M√ºnich, but the driver was about 4 hours late, because he did take a wrong route!Therefore we could not catch our next connection with Flixbus to Hamburg. We arrived at midnight, and we had anorther connection with another company to catch from Hamburg the next efternoon. So we talked to a guy in the Flixbus information at M√ºnich bus station, but he was like... I can\'t do anything, take another line next day and spend your night at a hostel! But we still had this connection from Hamburg that seemed to be impossible to reach. So no matter what, we just "lost" 2 tickets for a amount of 45 EURO.We asked him if Flixbus was going to pay for our expenses for the hostel and if they were willing to pay for some food?We did almost not have a break to eat during the 12 hour long bus trip. Especially the last few hours! But he was not willing to help, so we called the costumer service. The guy in the phone told us, that we could take a train, and the Flixbus would pay some of the expenses and refund the missing trip from Munich to Hamburg. "All" we had to do was to sent a traditionel letter with all the original tickets, and explaine our experience to Flixbus costumer service passengers rights. so we DID! TWO months ago and we still have not heard anything from them!I can not mention that I ever had had so bad experience before with any company.So please for your own sake DO NOT use Flixbus if you are going to plan a longer trip!!

The situation should have been handled immediately as the girls told them this problem right upon the time we should've been leaving .

{'review': "The trip was terrible. We would travel from Eindhoven to Stuttgart, with a connection in Dortmund. Our bus arrived with a delay of 2 hs and the driver said that the bus would stop in Dusseldorf and could not go to Dortmund.It took some time until my wife and I understood that, because we needed help of other people who spoke English and German to translate what the driver said (the driver didn't speak English). We don't know yet what happened, and why we couldn't reach Dortmund with the service.So, we were left in Dusseldorf near 1 am, and needed to arrive in Dortmund before 3 am. No one from Flixbus could help us, no English speaker.  We needed to call a friend to contact the customer service and get some help, since we were also not able to call them by ourselves.They suggested us to take a train between Dusseldorf-Dortmund, but it was not possible because it would arrive in time for our connection in Dortmund. This way, a guy from the costumer service that told us to pay a taxi and go to Dortmund, and that they would refund us with the value.  We took the taxi and spent 162 euros with that. We sent the receipts and information to the company by email and we had no answers (just the automatic ones). We called the customer service twice and they gave us template answers that our case will be analyzed and we should wait.There were almost 3 weeks since we did this terrible travel and we were not refund yet. We spent twice more than we planned. It would be better to buy another bus/train tickets in Dusseldorf and travel by ourselves because our financial loss would be smaller and we could enjoy the trip with no worries.I found here similar cases so I do not recommend the service. It was my first time using the Flixbus and the last one. I had never experienced something like that before.========================UPDATE: 24/08/16Hi, the customer service replied me after a period of a month and I was completely refund by the company.Thank you.Rafael.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "We purchased 2 tickets for 1/7/2016 for the London-Amsterdam Flixbus service for an urgent family matter, with a changeover in Brussels. 15 minutes before the planned 10am departure from London Victoria Coach Station, we received a text informing us about a 4.5 hour delay (!). Fearing that we will miss the connecting bus at Brussels and get stuck in the city overnight, I clicked on the link in the message to write an email cancelling the tickets and claiming a refund (an option in the message with the corresponding email link). Also, I purchased 2 tickets for the 11am service to Amsterdam (changeover in Antwerp, scheduled to arrive at 22:40) and boarded this bus. This was just the beginning of a nightmare journey.While waiting in the queue for the Eurotunnel in Folkestone, our driver informed us that that there is an expected delay of 3-4 hours due to a problem in the tunnel. While navigating with the bus in the queue, we had a minor accident with an adjacent car, which our bus driver ignored and drove off... It took 4 hours to cross the Channel indeed, but our driver ensured everyone that at the first stop in Europe he will announce contingency plans for those who were about to miss their connecting buses due to the delay. It never happened, and after we went passed our first scheduled stop in De Panne, I asked the driver in Brugge about the arrangements for the passengers who already missed their connecting bus in Antwerp and his promised announcement, that never happened. He nonchalantly told me that we should phone the customer service ourselves!!! In panic, I did so and explained the situation. The German operator (if you choose English, you are doomed: you get connected to an operator repeating the words 'refund or voucher' without even trying to understand the situation...) finally understood the nature of the trouble, and he called me back in 50 mins with the news that they've arranged a connecting bus at 22:00 from Brussels to Amsterdam that we'll catch. So we did, and finally got to Amsterdam just after midnight, which meant instead of public transport we had to take a taxi to our accomodation. We both were a distressed bag of nerves by then.You would believe that it's impossible to trump as a bad travel experience, but the return trip on the 4/7/2016 from Amsterdam to London (changeover in Antwerp, scheduled arrival: 17:45) added a new factor: the fear of death. Another non-communicating German driver decided to take a ferry (!) across the channel this time, a decision he made himself as I accidentally overheard him on the phone. He forgot to communicate this to the passengers, despite the fact it straightaway meant a 3-hour delay at the minimum compared to the Eurotunnel route.We were hours late arriving to London at night, when the top of our bus hit a height restricting barrier driving into a tunnel! And our driver didn't seem to care, he drove on into the tunnel as if nothing had happened!! We were literally fearing for our lives as the driver drove between the two tracks, trying to avoid crashing the top of the bus in the wall of the tunnel on either side. The driver then lost the plot completely: first he drove straight into the City of London, making a tricky U-turn after coming to a corner the bus could not manage. Then he got lost again right next to Victoria Coach Station, where he drove us to Brompton Road to make another road-blocking U-turn at the Victoria & Albert Museum. From this point a fellow passenger was helping the bus driver out with his phone and Google Maps to find the destination... Finally we arrived at Victoria Coach Station, and could only laugh when we had to drive out again to go to the international arrivals instead a block away. Almost 5 hours late, after another nerve-wrecking travel experience topped with a fear of death, we finally disembarked at 22:15.Despite several complaints through mail and phone, to this day we still haven't received a formal apology nor a refund from Flixbus for the cancelled trip. The elusive customer service line is total shambles, in three attempts asking for the refund I received the following replies on the phone, in chronological order:1. it will be transferred in 5 working days (didn't happen)2. I didn't claim a refund at all, they haven't registered anything3. and lastly, it will be transferred in 4-6 weeks(!!!)", 'stars': '1'}

This 5:45am bus never arrived. After 6 am one guy telelephoned Flixbus as there were a few of us waiting for this bus and we were all getting anxious as we had flights to catch, he was told it would be another 10 minutes.  At 6:30am the 6:15am bus arrived 15 minutes late and it took all of us that we're waiting. Once on the bus we had no internet service at all.Unfortunately for those of us that had been waiting for the 5:45am bus we didn't arrive at Berlin SXF until 9:10am.For myself and others the boarding gate had closed. I had missed my flight and my connecting flight in Paris and any chance of getting home that afternoon. So after an overnight train journey and a full next day on a train and 350euro out of pocket I finally arrived home the next day at 5pm.When I arrived home I sent a complaint about the fact the bus never turned up nor had I been notified it wasn't coming plus the fact that I had paid 19 euro for the 5:45am bus and the 6:15 bus had only been 12 euro when I had booked it. The reply back was I should of allowed more time for my flight and to send my booking number so they could inform me as to why I hadn't been notified of the delay. I have had no reply and have since sent another complaint but have had no response. If the bus had of arrived on time and we had of been delayed on route to Berlin due to traffic problems or an accident , then I could understand. But for the bus to not turn up at all and no notification to anyone that there would be a delay ...to me that is totally unacceptable and disgusting. IT WAS A BUS GOING TO AN AIRPORT of course people have flights to catch.Reply to FlixbusThanks for your reply Flixbus. I did give my phone number but it appears it didn't go through. I had 3 trips booked with your company in that week I gave my number with each booking, the ph number came through on the other two bookings but doesn't appear on this one. Seeing as your buses travel such long distances and you offer bus services to airports. Maybe it could be bought to customers attention when making a booking that these buses can run up to 11/2 to 2hrs late due to the distance they have to travel and the possibility of traffic delays and driver rest breaks. As when I booked your bus the web site gave 3 departure time options 3.20am 5:45am  6:15am that morning of three buses arriving Berlin SXF from Dresden that morning all with an arrival time before 9am and in actual fact due to traffic delays etc that you are claiming? Supposedly only the early bus at 3.20am would of made it before 9am. Had I been made aware of this fact prior to booking I could of booked the earlier bus. There were a few distressed people waiting for that bus on the 29th and a few people did miss their flight. When the booking is made it doesn't mention where the bus is coming from and that it could have long delays. In all fairness to your customers this should be clearly stated.", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "I booked a return from from Eindhoven to Bruges with Flixbus, thinking that it would be more convenient and less stressful than driving. However, that was a mistake. A few things to be aware of if you're considering booking Flixbus:1) The bus can run extremely late, and they won't inform you of it accurately. From Eindhoven to Bruges, the bus arrived 30 minutes late, and on the way back, the bus arrived an hour late. In the end, along with a 45 minute 'break' at a remote gas station despite the fact that we were running extremely late already, I arrived in Eindhoven 2 hours later than the time given by Flixbus.2) Nothing works. The toilet wasn't working, and the wifi that they advertise  for all trips is a false claim because it apparently doesn't work outside of Germany. 3) Extremely unfriendly staff. The bus driver snapped at passengers who asked why we had to have a 45 minute stop at a remote gas station when the bus was already running 1.5 hours late. My guess is that it's a legal requirement, but it's only a guess because we were given no explanation about it. If the driver would taken the time to explain the reason for the stop, we would have all been in a better mood.In conclusion, whilst Flixbus is a great concept and appears to offer a convenient alternative to driving or trains, I would advise users to think twice before booking because he or she may be in a for a long and frustrating journey.", 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "I booked with Flixbus 2 rides. One from Venice to Ljubljana and the other from Ljubljana to Zagreb. The second one was an awful experience. The departure should have been in 4:30 in the morning. I waited until 5:30 and as I had not clue if it is just late or if it won't come at all, so I took a train at 6:20.I was waiting in the pouring rain with only 1 hour of sleep and was frustrated to find that their 24 7 service is not available. I contacted them trough Facebook and they responded while I was already in train for Zagreb and said to me that the bus was late 30 minutes. This was an obvious lie, so I got even more frustrated. There is one place where Flexibus gather in Ljubljana I was in front of it the whole time.So, the biggest problem was not that it was late but that they would not accept to give me a refund wich is in my opinion considerably small when comparing how frustrated I am now and that I will share my bad experience with this company with my friends and family. So, hopefully they will not do business with them as I did.They can be called Flexibus as I see that they are flexible with their timeline.

{'review': 'I am extremely disappointed in this company. After hearing good things of Flixbus my boyfriend and I travelled a return journey from Brugge - London. On the outbound journey, the bus was late. Ok, we overlooked this. It was one hour 45 minutes late, with no apology from the driver. During the journey however, the bus pulled over onto a semi-pavement/dirt track in a main road of a small town for a \'change of driver\'. We were told (only after we probed as no communication had otherwise been given) that this would take 15 minutes. One hour later it was still \'15 minutes\'. Three hours later and we were tired, confused from lack of any communication and worried that we would never get going again. Eventually after 3 1/2 hours we were moving. Again no apology from the driver that left us, nor the new one.On the return journey we had the joy of experiencing yet again Flix\'s operational absurdities and absolutely unacceptable customer service. We arrived at London Victoria well ahead of the 11am departure, to wait at gate 13, as indicated by both National Express staff and the departure boards. We waited, and waited. As we questioned the whereabouts of the coach at 11am to our horror we saw the Flix bus departing and our board at gate 13 suddenly change. With no announcement or board change, or any logical reason at all, the bus departed from a different gate. Thus begun a painful 2 and a half hour ping pong battle with Flix\'s customer service in both Berlin and Macedonia. Without going into all the detail, \'advice\' given varied from "Sorry but our system said everything was in order", "you can get the bus tomorrow", "no we can\'t refund you but you can get vouchers" to, unbelievably, "it\'s not our fault, it\'s yours!" - followed by a hanging up by the advisor!! I, my boyfriend, and the other couple in the same situation have wasted hundreds of euros on phone calls to the company, many of which ended with the advisor saying "we will call you back" ,which never occurred, or simply by them putting us on hold for 15 minutes and then hanging up. This company has some serious operational and communication procedures to be put in place. We will be requesting a refund for both our journeys and our phone bills to the \'advisors\'. Oh, and the toilet and WiFi did not work in either of our busses. Icing on the cake.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I went now two times with Flixbus from Brussels to Amsterdam. A budget alternative to trains in Belgium permanently being on strike. I did not have serious issues, apart from first time seeking for the bus, as it did not have a logo, no internet during the travelling in Belgium and a 45 min delay on my second trip. Well, the latter can happen around Brussels.More disappointing was the situation for other travellers. The two connections before the mine were not arriving and people had to wait without any information (for what do you give your mobile number then) from 3 or 5 pm until 8 pm to finally enter their bus. No info, no drinks on a hot day, no nothing. How can you do that to people? To your customers?So if you do not have to take Flixbus, at least form Brussels to Amsterdam, then do not. It can be OK but also a disaster.', 'stars': '3'}

{'review': 'I booked a trip from Brussels to Mainz. There was no direct bus, so I had to change on Leverkusen Mitte. I spontaneously decided to do this trip, so I had booked just 3 days before my departure. Usually, I use train, but in that situation I wanted to try a bus to discover one more city on my way to Mainz. Of course, after I realized that Leverkusen is not the best choice. The trip was very well priced, I paid around 40 EUR, relatively around 10 per each bus I used. Starting from Brussels to Leverkusen Mitte(the first bus), everything was fine. I did not try the wi-fi on the first bus. However, I did not like the second part of the trip from Leverkusen Mitte to Mainz, because of delay. This is not something to blame the company for. They send me two messages that the bus will be late 50 minutes and 75 minutes. The bus arrived with 105 minutes delay. The wi-fi on this one was extremely slow, even though most of the people were sleeping. I was 2 seats away from the toilet, it was smelling unfortunately. The driver was the worst experience on this trip. I am not aware how many breaks usually a driver should do, but this one did once 20 minutes and once 5 minutes for 200km. He even got confused in Wiesbaden and went into wrong direction which caused even bigger delay. On my way back everything was good. The drivers were very nice, especially from Leverkusen to Brussels. The wi-fi was working good. There was even a coffee machine in the bus, I think the coffee was for free, but I am not sure. Overall I would grade that company with 7 out of 10. The advantages are free wi-fi, good price/quality, relatively new buses, not so many ppl, in 3 out of 4 journeys I was sitting alone, plenty of space between the seats.Disadvantages - the driver in the second bus, some maintenance issues like some lamps were missing and when the air-conditioning is turned on you have to put something in the hole in order to stop the cool stream.', 'stars': '4'}

{'review': "The title may seem as though I am being dramatic but I can assure you not. I have only just got back to my home from a Flixbus journey (a disgraceful journey) i am in the process of writing a complaint and I can only hope this company give a little bit of justice and refund my ticket and compensate me for my losses. I travelled from London Victoria Coach Station - Basel, Switzerland (via Dusseldorf) on the way there which although because of traffic it was late and I nearly missed my connection. I made it and the staff on this particular coach were polite and helpful. However what happened after is vile and disgusting to treat humans like this. Leaving Basel to head to London via Frankfurt I received a text message saying our coach was ONE hour late. I stood in the rain outside a bus stop without shelters waiting and it eventually turned up TWO hours late. This made me nervous about missing my connection from Frankfurt. This was booked as a package by the company so it is Flixbus' responsibility and Flixbus should take the blame for this. We arrived in Frankfurt one hour and forty-five minutes late but was assured by the driver of this bus that our connection was also running late. We stood outside in the cold waiting and waiting for almost four hours requesting help from a large number (around 15-20) bus drivers some of whom refused to help, some laughed at us and even one who told us they didn't work for Flixbus which was a lie. We tried to call the help line which was closed. (wasting our money and phone battery) When we asked a driver to assist us he shut the door in our face and when we were stood infront of the bus he proceeded to drive towards us shoving us with the bus until we were forced to leave the road as he would have ran us over. This is VILE behaviour and lack of human respect. At this point there were five people stranded in Frankfurt with no knowledge of any German. We didn't know any information and no-one was willing to help us. Eventually a driver on the Frankfurt-Berlin service (Len i think his name was) actually helped us and he organised us to get a coach to Dortmund then to London at 2.10am we would have been half way to London at this point but we were just stuck in Germany. We sat around in the cold and had to take money out as I didn't exchange for euros as it did not state that we were going to be left by this pathetic excuse of a transport company. This is at a charge to my bank aswell. When we get on the bus to Dortmund that was ok but overcrowded. The bus to London from Dortmund was scheduled to leave at 6.30am; ten hours after our connection was scheduled to leave so after ten hours of being stranded in Germany we were finally in the right direction. However this bus was around half an hour to forty-five minutes late and the driver refused us entry and told us he did not have time to call the office to check it out and didn't have time for us. In protest we refused to leave the bus and he went to get the local police involved to kick us off which they understood our side and the driver called the office, without apologizing he just got in and drove on; knowing he was in the wrong. The lack of communication between this company is shocking. This driver spent the next hours he was driving chatting on a mobile whilst in control of a bus on the busy roads. This journey was ok with a minor delay. I already had a connecting Journey booked two and a half hours after we were supposed to get in the London; the time gap was to accomodate for traffic or delays. This was non-refundable and non-transferrable. I was supposed to be working that evening so i have lost a day's work because of this company. They have no respect for their customers and cannot even keep their customers informed. Eventually i had to pay an extra ¬£55 to get the train home and then petrol money for a family member to pick me up from the train station. This mistake by FlixBus has cost me around ¬£100 in total for transport charges and my missed connection, meals to accomodate the extra time we spent in Germany and the loss of earnings from being unable to go to work; also for the cost of withdrawing money from my account.  As this was booked as a package and I didn't choose the company did; they are liable and should take full responsibility. The company should have allowed their buses enough time to connections and if it was essential they leave on time; hardly ever then arrange an alternate route. I would like a refund on the cost of my ticket and to be reimbursed for my connection travel once i was in London; aswell as if there was any justice, for the hours I spent sat in the cold on the streets of Frankfurt, waiting for a bus that already left without us. I believe this is enough to generate compensation as it is shocking behaviour and it is a vile way to treat paying customers. Flixbus expect a detailed complaint from me with a full account of what happened. I eventually arrived at my home at 10pm Friday 20 May instead of 2.30pm because we were abandoned by FlixBus.I would strongly advise anybody looking to travel to not use this company as they have no respect for their customers and a severe lack of customer service skills and dealing with issues.UPDATE: TWO WEEKS LATER AND STILL NO REPLY.

{'review': 'I traveled with Flixbus from Amsterdam to London, and had a terrible journey with them. I then proceeded to call them and was told to send an email to Forderungs Management. I did that but it has been more than 2 weeks and I still have not received any reply. I therefore decided to leave a review, by copy and pasting my complaint email below, which described my terrible experience in detail."Dear Forderungs Management,I am writing to you to request a refund for my trip from Brussels-North Station to London Victoria Coach Station on May 3rd 2016.I am sure I am not the only one who has sent an email regarding this specific journey, because it was a very frustrating journey.Below I will give you the account of what happened.Bus N84 arrived one hour late at Brussels North Station. We were scheduled to depart at 2.20am, but we ended up departing only at 3.30am. During this one hour, passengers were forced to wait outside in the pouring rain with not much shelter in the middle of the night. We were not at all informed of the delay, and were left wondering whether the bus was coming at all. We did not receive any text messages to inform us of the delay. When the bus finally arrived, the drivers had no communication with the passengers about what caused their delay, and there was no apology.At the French border, we were delayed by at least another hour. There was a couple on the bus who had their dog with them and apparently that caused them a huge problem. We don\'t know the exact details of this incident because the drivers again, did not communicate with us on what was happening. Again, we were left in the dark, forever waiting for the bus to move. When we finally moved a few meters and arrived at the UK Border Control, the same couple ran into trouble again because of their dog, causing us another 1 hour and 30 minutes delay. We were scheduled to take the eurotunnel at 6:50 am, but because of the delay, we only took it at 9:20 am. I also need to remind you that on my ticket, it said that the arrival time is 8:15 am in London, so the equivalent of 9:15 am Brussels time. At 9:15 am, we were still in the bus in France. We were also during this whole time, were not let out of the bus, and so we could not get any breakfast to eat. The last meal I had was dinner the previous day, on the 2nd of May.We finally arrived in London at around 11 am (UK time), but only to be at the wrong side of the station because the drivers failed to understand that departure and arrivals were not at the same place. Moreover, when a staff of the London Victoria Coach Station asked the driver whether he is arriving or departing, he said "Departure". I was coincidentally near the driver, so I then proceeded to shout out the window at the staff to tell him that we are actually just arriving, and that we are 3 hours delayed. The drivers were laughing at the fact that we were delayed by 3 hours.My partner and I had another connection bus to catch at Victoria Coach Station that was departing at 11am. We missed it, because we were still in the bus as the drivers navigate themselves to the correct arrivals area of the station. The communication between the bus drivers and the staff that was assisting in giving directions, was comical. The drivers\' English proficiency was very poor, and the staff member was forced to use very simple baby English. When we finally were allowed to leave the bus, it was clear that my partner and I have missed our connection bus. We were then forced to buy another ticket, which was more expensive that the initial tickets we had.Due to this massive delay, we were also forced to cancel all our meetings for that day and this has caused us much inconvenience. Due to this, we then had to reschedule our entire week, which proved to be very difficult and problematic. I am therefore asking for a full refund for this trip. The pain we went through was unacceptable."I hope that the management will finally take action and reply to my email.', 'stars': '1'}

I then approached him asking if there is any shops where I can buy food as I am pregnant and need to eat frequantly. I left my hotel early morning without food thinking there will be a shop at the terminal. He then ask me to say what I said in French. I told him unfortunately I can not speak French and He just mubled somthing and waved his hand at me to leave. I again asked so there is no place to buy food and he started raising his voice saying things in French and told me NO FOOD! No SHOP! Wait till Paris!!! NO FOOD!!He then politely looked at the rest of the people and told them in French to board the bus. I stood in line but he them looked at me skipped me and went around me and helped the men (French) behind me and only lastly mumbled something in French and helped me last. After that he continued to be rude to me where I said nothing. All I asked "in English" was where I could buy food. This man was not only rude and disrepectful to a pregnant woman. He  was a racist agains the "English"I would suggest if you do chose their services rather not speak!', 'stars': '1'}

I was travelling with my family including my daughter who is 7 months old. We were asked to bring a baby seat, which i was unable to arrange,then we were asked to contact the customer service, which was always occuppied and difficult to reach through. The bus left without us. We had travelled through flix bus in the morning from prague to dresden,no one asked us for a baby seat! Indeed we travelled to cesky krumlov using flix bus, we were not asked to bring a baby seat. I had noted a family with a small kid, when i pointed out, that if others can travel without a baby seat, why cant we? The answers were vague. If the baby seats are mandatory, it should be provided by the carrier, not the passenger.Subsequently we travelled to prague by a student agency bus, no one there asked us to bring a baby seat. I have written a complaint to flix bus twice, but no response so far! Thanks flix bus for wasting my money, time and poor handling of the situation by your dresden staff.', 'stars': '2'}

I have had a great deal of experience traveling on buses, trains and planes with my gear, and most companies have been willing to work with me to make sure that my guitar, most importantly, is safe.  On quiet services with other carriers, with enough space, I have been allowed to put my guitar, which travels in a soft case, in the overhead compartments, where it fits easily and without difficulty.  On busier services I have been allowed to hold it in my lap.  On Flixbus however, I have found several drivers to be unreasonable and bullying in their approach to asking me to put my guitar in the luggage compartment.  There has been no flexibility or understanding from them; only a dogmatic insistence on the Flixbus rule that guitars must be stowed, combined with a completely unsatisfactory place for my guitar, in with all the other bags.  If Flixbus is going to insist that fragile luggage like this cannot go in the cabin, even when the bus is only half-full, they have to offer a safe alternative to the luggage hold, where a guitar like mine could easily be crushed.', 'stars': '2'}

I travel after six on a Friday and would like to travel around eleven pm Sunday if you had a non stop (perhaps only a break for the driver half way).The trip is unnecessarily long, if I drive it takes a Max of eight hours rather than the horrible 12 to thirteen on these trips. I and many others will choose to ride share rather than bus as faster and more comfortable.Additionally I would like that the buses have a strict no alcohol on board rule! Often there are many intoxicated people, mostly men who are very difficult to travel with. And the smell in the stuffy hot bus can become unbearable at times.The drivers are always very nice and informative.Please let me know if you will be providing a faster direct bus.', 'stars': '3'}
{'review': '- Internet in not working on board (50-50)- Usually on schedule- Bus drivers are usually very friendly but sometimes very aggressive- If you are unlucky, the bathroom might not be working- Bus usually clean but sometimes very dirty I am a frequent user of your services. I am not telling my opinion as I am reporting my experiences with Flixbus. Please do not justify and save your efforts for solving your quality issues. You have the foundation of being an excellent service provider just dont screw it up!', 'stars': '3'}
{'review': 'I have travelled using Flixbus several times since moving to Berlin in February 2015.  I find it to be a good alternative to the train.  The buses are always comfortable with a clean restroom, comfy seats, and fully stocked snack selection.  My last bus from Flensburg also had a hot drink machine.  I also appreciate the power outlets and FREE Wi-fi plus a selection of movies, which stream very smoothly.  Here are my recommendations to further improve Flixbus:1. Clarify how many stops there will be between the point of origin and destination.  When I traveled to Flensburg, there were approximately 4 stops but the ticket said "Direct".  2. Instruct Driver\'s to announce all the stop names.  Often times, I am going to town that I have not yet visited and I do not know when I have arrived.  Plus, maybe I would like to come visit a town through which we have travelled.3. Improve Delay notification - For the most part, Flixbus has been pretty punctual, but delays happen...I just want to know a realistic estimate of the time of arrival.  Update times if necessary.4.  Movies - (are AWESOME!) - it would be great if one could easily determine which were dubbed and which are in original language.5. Bus stop arrival/departure signage/instructions - for the most part, it has been easy to determine from where the bus to my destination will be departing (especially in Berlin), but Dresden was a real challenge.  It\'s a wide spanning area and when I last travelled there were signs differentiating destinations (maybe this has been updated?).Overall, these are small details. Flixbus is the best deal on last minute travel within Germany based on price, service, and reliability.  I will continue to highly recommend your company.', 'stars': '5'}

{'review': "Have used flixbus extensively while travelling around Europe over the last few months and the value for mkney against other forms of transport can't be beaten. With the bonus of wifi and ac plugs plus more comfortable chairs than most other bus companies, it's the best way to travel on a budget.", 'stars': '5'}
