We want to drive to Leipzig next week three weeks and have already booked our tickets in about September.

The substitute stop is much further away from our hotel and we have a woman with back problems, which also has a disabled passport. She can not walk with her suitcase now the route to the hotel. Since we have asked by email the request to Flixbus, 1. Why this was not already made known to us at the time of booking, the Christmas market in Leipzig is always in the same place and so the problem should have been known soon enough and 2. As you can see that now with the fees for the cancellation? After all, per ride per person 1 Euro and then you do not get the money but a voucher. We do not even know if we go by bus again.

One directly in front of the train station and one across the street (big street that can only be crossed by an underpass). We were an hour before departure at the train station to find out which bus stop the bus departs. At both stops is the drive to Regensburg turn, not very helpful and totally confusing for people who do not know. But since on the ticket 'in front of the station' we also decided for this stop, as there were two more people for our bus arrived we were pretty sure that we were right. Then a bus came across the street. One of us went there to see if we were possibly wrong, even before he reached the bus, this drove off already. Still we thought that's not our bus, because he drove rather than ours should. After 10 minutes I then called the Flixbus hotline and after 5 minutes on hold I was told that this was our bus. I said he can not drive when 4 people are missing and then even more than stated. The answer was 'the bus drivers do not even know how many passengers they have'. There was no other bus on this day to Regensburg or surroundings. For our ticket s we have only one coupon -2 € cancellation fees. No money back !! We had to go by train and get picked up in mushrooms, as no train drove to DE. Of course that cost us much more money and time. At home we were 2 o'clock instead of 23 o'clock.

Shortly thereafter, I sent the train ticket to Flixbus and asked how the reimbursement of the costs will be made , On the answer, there would be a refund only in case of delayed departure time of the bus, which is not true in this case. After another email, I received the answer, they wanted to "check" again. Fault: Technical faults are avoidable and the responsibility lies at Flixbus. Therefore arriving after three changes and arriving with 2.5 hours delay is more than annoying.

Reckless fellow travelers were exhausting - noisy conversations and phone calls in the middle of the night do not have to be real.

Nice and good. When I got in I noticed that the bus looked pretty dirty, in the gaps between the window and the seat was all dirty on the floor. Times quite off that on my curtain something brown / red stuck what I did not want to define in more detail. On the descent was no real announcement nor was it declared that you should buckle up or how to turn on the light on the toilet. Accordingly, the first 5 passengers went to the bathroom with their mobile phone lamp. I used to be used to taking regular breaks, especially for smokers. I must also criticize that, the driver never stopped and drove on immediately. What can be quite exhausting with a journey of 7 hours. Finally arrived in Freiburg, I took the short opportunity to go out to quickly smoke one. After a few moves, the doors closed and the driver drove off. I was just able to get in fast, but 3 others were still outside. 2 of the passengers on the bus rushed to stop the driver. After all then back on the bus and the bus moved a few meters, we stopped again. The driver had left the flaps open at the bottom of the bus where the suitcases were stowed. They had to be closed then. On the whole, a huge horror for me. At the departure in Freiburg then came an announcement with "Next stop Bern at 13:25 clock" which was completely wrong. We were not even over the border! And the next station was Basel. Finally, I arrived on time as on my ticket listed in Bern.', 'stars': '2'}

{'review': "Ok, Flixbus has apparently deleted my comment on Facebook, so I use the opportunity for another platform ... please: Last Friday evening (27.10.2017) I got in Lyon to overnight to Frankfurt / airport to drive to Erfurt , The bus was cracking and very tight including emergency seat. The woman in front of me folded her seat just as well, so that I had even less space with long legs. She ignored my advice a short time later (Merci beaucoup!). By night I actually understand that the bus passes a certain distance and does not stop in every major city. Not so FlixBus! He stopped in Geneva, Lausanne (here in full Montour the light and 20 minutes break - seriously?) And Basel (again great light on). It was impossible to think about continuous sleep. The coronation was still that the bus driver from Freiburg i. Breisgau should actually change. This was nothing, because the replacement driver was sick leave and there was simply no substitute. Whether intentional or not, you could hear over the microphone the telephone conversation between driver and supervisor well and clearly in the back row. The bus driver sounded pretty exhausted. He had to continue until shortly before Heidelberg, where at least there a transfer could be made. Bus driver was - understandably - annoyed, the passengers, who arrived too late, were-understandably-also annoyed, heated accordingly was the conversation. The bus finally arrived one hour late in Frankfurt / Airport. My connection bus was delayed at first 1.5 hours and only after I had called in the service center, one noticed that the bus altogether at 2h45min would be late. The bus was again crackling, although I would like to sit alone after the long ride sometimes even to sleep. Instead of the expected 18 hour drive I was finally 22h on the way. If you stop at night in every major city, you could at least -generally also for a small fee- Blindfolds and Oropax offer, this did not appear. Someone like me, who sleeps well, does not think about something like that before the ride, but it is a good service. Vll you can also seat assignments, so that guests who are on the road all night to the terminus, can sleep in the back and not the whole bus the lights must be turned on.

The toilet stank pitifully, so that the travelers who sat in the immediate vicinity, the nose shut up when the toilet door opened. The bus driver was unfriendly to aggressive, but drove at least reliably.And on my return I saw then that I had been deducted the canceled account booking. At my request, I received the notification that I could get the money back, minus a handling fee of 2 euros. My question, why I would have to take over the 2 euros, since this is not my fault, remained unanswered until today and I was not refunded the amount either.

But bus drove away to the minute, eternally discussed for reimbursement, nothing went by phone, because the telephone operator a) did not understand and b) pretended to ask her boss- but she did not, she chatted with her colleague , I understand Russian, well ... so I\'m 4 hours late for family celebration. Frustration again. I asked drivers if I could sit on 1 because otherwise I would feel sick - no one was sitting there - he just waved around and meant no, I asked why not, no answer. Minutes later there was a teenager, the bus driver had reserved for friends. I like juggling with my nausea for a 13-year-old, who could have been in the second row or next to the unfriendly grandpa, also at the front. He just did not want to leave me next to him. Point. Fact also seems that "regulars" already extend their claws to be far enough away from the Dauerstinkurinal, one is already entering with frustration.

The busses inside neat, average good seating, not handicapped accessible. WLAN o. K., In the basement odor nuisance by toilet. Only cold drinks and a few sweet snacks are offered. The driver in Aachen came in the morning about 10 minutes later, but was very friendly and fix. Shortly before Munich, the toilet was cleaned (?!); a little later came the statement that all passengers have to change to another bus - this bus must be in regular maintenance after a one-week use. Hee? Maintenance is known to be "planned", what was wrong - the reason for the communication, the technical condition of the bus, poor planning of the maintenance or the lack of interest in customers? Overall, a delay of about 30 Minuten.Der bus for return (21:30) came in time, the driver was nice and competent. But his colleague ... He ran with unclear "goal" several times around the bus through the crowd of waiting passengers with the statement "I need space!", Without causing anything. Then both disappeared, the departure time was now clearly exceeded. Then they came back, and the "companion" began again to push through the waiting, shaking again and again at the one luggage door, which was obviously closed. Finally, with a force that the latch almost flew away ... I do not know if the door has survived the well. The driver came in, quietly pointing at the other, beside the existing and unfinished luggage door, and the opportunity to open the second locked door from the inside. Now the "companion" was shaking the inside of the said door with all his strength ... (you already suspect? Yes, with "zero success"). The driver tried all the keys, and one fit ... The passengers crowded from one bus entrance door to the other, because it was not clear how to proceed - check in first or drop off your suitcases. The "companion" now stepped out of the inside of the luggage compartment, shooing the people standing in front of him again with his "I need space here!" and the call "Amsterdam!" Many came forward, under it directly in front of him standing couple with a toddler and stroller. There was an immediate discussion about the number of luggage and passengers, he always counted with the accompanying family member. Nothing happened until the driver helped. As someone "Rotterdam?" asked, the "companion" dismissed this brusquely - "I said Amsterdam, understood!" The driver has just helped. The passengers were extremely angry, one has already threatened with beatings. Finally, everyone found a place in the bus, there were still a number of empty seats; whoever could, availed the free seat to sleep until we left Stuttgart stop, so around 01: 10h. The "companion" answered with "I need all seats immediately, for 15 people!" and shook anyone who has used a vacant space. Someone\'s shoes had slipped into the corridor, the "companion" was already yelling, "Whose shoes, whose shoes?" and shook people again with "Are they their shoes?". Now an elderly lady came who was torn from sleep and did not understand what was going on - she also explained that she was hearing-impaired and could not understand what her "companion" wanted from her. There was again incomprehensible discussion on the part of the "companion" because of hand luggage of the woman, he threatened her with police use and ejection from the bus, reported by mobile phone already a bus delay because of "claim of Mehrplatz o. by the woman and the planned deployment in the headquarters. That would mean a considerable delay for everyone. After extensive measurement of the hand luggage by the "companion" and "penalty payment" the journey continued with the woman and her luggage. After the following stop there were still some free seats ... Aachen we reached with 30 minutes delay and a fresh Crew.Fazit: The rides are cheap, previous drivers good. No value is placed on service, no value is placed on the crew. The burden on the crew is inappropriate, people are sorry for me. This then comes 1: 1 at the riders. Flixbus has no clientele but a Busauslastungsmenge, now this company uses the position of the provider market.

So good cheer and then: Oh no. My jacket is in the bus. At ALexanderplatz there is a luck a Flixbus office. And then the problems started.

The passage "I\'m sorry to hear that" at the beginning of her lecture lesson I did not take seriously and I felt foolhardy. It made me rather angry how to handle customer problems. For training on congruence in the telephone consultation between conversation content and voice, there seems to be no contingent at Flixbus. Again, the standard monotone answer: Contacting the bus driver is not möglich.Ich the bus goes on to Dresden.

These are not always communicated to customers, so you can also wait for hours at the stops. Trips are almost always planned so that the targeted travel times are not unsustainable. Regular driver changes are made during interim stops at motorway rest stops instead of stops, which is almost always time-consuming and as good as always longer than the announced "10 minutes". If an incident such as an accident or a defect happens, it can only be for hours until replacement is provided. As for the cancellation, I am also very dissatisfied. It has happened to me more than once that Flixbus has rebooked me for other trips because the booked trip has been canceled. Since these had never suited me, however, I was allowed to pay the cancellation fee to get a part of the price back. Whereby getting money back would be overpaid, because there is no money back. The company Flixbus finally dares to send only coupons. Conclusion: If I did not depend on the low prices to be able to go home regularly as a student, I would NOT recommend this company to anyone.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'They do not wait for passengers, even on international long-haul flights, and they lie on the phone (hotline) when they say that any costs incurred will be reimbursed for delay. Most of their bus drivers are incompetent and often do not even know where to go. Only the buses are very good, but otherwise everything is a joke. On the website there are only positive reviews but if it goes on, no one will drive more with the Flixbus. They are not customer focused and let their customers down. Terrible that something like this comes from Germany. I am very disappointed unfortunately. Buses are not trains and you have to wait for the passengers, especially on long international trips and you have to know the number of bus drivers for the older people.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'On the whole, I was very happy with the ride! Good price and a pleasant atmosphere. But still a bit Whack.Da but I drove from Rijeka to Vienna, the ride was very long and I noticed a few unpleasant things. I hardly slept in the night before the ride and was not showering why I had a slightly unpleasant body odor. Once when I wanted to get off the bus, I fell down the stairs and unintentionally kicked a girl. My neighbor, a very nice girl who had sweetened my ride a bit, wanted to play with me "city, country, river", but I was really bad. Most of the time I had to drive, and although I\'m a pretty talkative person, I play "Silent Fir" and just be quiet as the other passengers wanted to enjoy a quiet ride. There was also the problem that although each seat a reading light was provided, but my fault was. Soon my phone had no battery and of course my charging cable gave up the ghost during the bus ride. The bus was about half an hour late because we stood on the A1 in a traffic jam. At the beginning of the ride I wanted to sleep, because I had the same as I said the night before little sleep. Unfortunately, we were on a fairly winding track at that time and every time I nodded I almost fell into the hall at every turn, as I regretfully did not get a window seat. Still, I could enjoy the wonderful view as my neighbor, who has been climbing my bag all the time, slept most of the time and gave me an excellent view out the window. Very pleasant was the fact that you could adjust the seats to a comfortable location. My travel companion Leo, however, enjoyed sitting alone and claiming two seats for himself. He curled up and fell asleep as sweet as a honeybee in a chocolate coat on the two seats. When he awoke he massaged my head, which I also liked very much. Since the ride was very long made our sympathetic bus driver in regular sections 15min break time. It was a very pleasant, a bit chaotic ride and I would go with FlixBus again and again, only I find train driving just geiler.Lg Felicitas', 'stars': '4'}

When I was in the morning in front of the bus, nobody knew about it and they sold me for stupid. The behavior of the bus driver and his co-worker was stubborn and unprofessional. A rider who had the same problem, called sweetheart or sweetheart. The bus driver demanded for the camping chair and the pitch tent € 9 (total € 18!).

According to Flixbus, all buses are searched at the end of the day (the bus driver also said while driving that would be the last ride for today). For lost things there is unfortunately no telephone service and you have to fill out a form. I waited for an entire month for the answer. It was then only that nothing was found and basta. The service here is so incredibly bad - you hardly get support and has no direct contact. On the phone you do not help one. On the internet, I was able to research that many got their things back - but these were just clothes or rather worthless items. Jewelry, laptops, mobile phones and the like usually do not seem to emerge anymore. (There are really hundreds of contributions) Despite the really great Fernbussidee I have to deduct all stars. That expensive items disappear (whether in the bus or later in the lost property office) is simply not - I want to make any direct blame, but something does not seem to vote there.

NO MORE BUS! I really never write reviews but this is too much the German drivers are SOOO RUDE they shout at people like we\'re cattle - literally! They seem to have completely forgotten that the people they transport are CUSTOMERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES! They sometimes try to make a few jokes at the beginning of the travel but good luck understanding it\'s only in German. This "sympathy" doesn\'t compensate their rudeness at all in my opinion. - Don\'t put any fragile items in you bag going in the lock it will be (every time) thrown literally on the floor and in/off the lock as a piece of garbage in the trash - and they\'re very likely to throw bags on top of yours. - I write this as we just went out for a 5min break and in the middle of the break someone was walking a bit too far for the driver\'s (or should I say Kommandant?!) taste. The driver went completely mad and shouted at him to come back (I guess, German again...) and cancelled the break for everyone shouting all passengers to get back on the bus. "no brain, no break" ("kein kopf" that\'s all I understood with my bad German level) - And last but not least... Don\'t forget your ID it\'s been twice now I see people getting denied the access to the bus. Story#1: Tears, shouting, familiy stuck at the Paris bus station at 9pm with no care, rudeness, and no compassion whatsoever. No solution offered for them either for where to spend the night, they are left on the street just because one person amongst 6 have no proper ID?! But they have loads of papers, they paid their tickets, they have small babies, they look totally desperate and the only thing you find is to shout at them in German and a few English words?! "NO PASSPORT NO BUS!".... Honestly after that you leave and make jokes? Personally as a passenger I feel awful and disgusted to be in this bus, leaving Paris with a family in tears on the parking. Story#2: leaving Berlin this time. They made a woman cry again. She is pregnant and she has a ticket but apparently not the right ID?! It last about 15 minutes of shouting at her and her crying. Everyone is kind of boarding, she\'s going to be left in the evening at the bus station. Fortunately a girl speaking German starts being on her side and shout at the driv-Kommandant and they all finally realised that she - as a EU citizen - has the right to travel in this bus and her ID papers are enough. She finally got in the bus... Lucky EU passport... NOW SERIOUSLY GUYS YOU ARE ONLY BUS DRIVERS MENT TO BRING PEOPLE FROM POINT A TO POINT B.

{'review': 'This was definitely my last trip with Flixbus! Originally I was an absolute fan. I loved this uncomplicated way to travel because it was a cool and inexpensive alternative to the train and because the service was measured at the customer\'s request. Everything that did not bother anyone was allowed. If the bus was not too crowded, you could take a small suitcase in the passenger compartment. That was discontinued sometime. A pity, but no end of the world. A while later, the size of the hand luggage was mandatory. OK, I thought and yesterday packed a suitcase and a backpack for my personal belongings, which I did not want to lose sight of. Yesterday, this backpack was no longer allowed, so I had to carry laptop, mouse, charger, thermos, food box, water bottle, sunglasses, reading glasses, reading, wallet and last but not least cell phone loose in the bus. With these many (not quite worthless) items in my arms, I tried to show the bus driver my cell phone ticket. When I had finally taken a sweaty seat and took a short breath, an employee made me aware of the fixed at each place house rules, after which it is prohibited to place objects on the neighboring seat. So I distributed the things on the shelf, which is attached to the seat of the front man and at my feet, with the result that at every turn one or the other flew through the bus. In fact, I was already extremely annoyed when the sun burned my brain. I just wanted to draw the beautiful thick curtain when I discovered the sign on which this "for security" was prohibited. Unfortunately, I had already booked the return trip and was prepared for the worst. Also this bus was late, so I waited for the already 15 minutes, which one should be there earlier, another 15 minutes with about 100 other people (who of course did not all have the same destination) and in the rain. When the bus finally arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. Nobody refused to take my backpack with me, no one nagged me for placing it in the free seat next to me and there was no sign that said curtains were not allowed to close. I felt like riding Flixbus once before meant "freedom and adventure" and "warm welcome" was not just a slogan.

{'review': "I was travelling with the Flixbus from Paris to Leiden (route 803, departing from Port Maillot, Paris on 2.06.17 at 22.15). There were two drivers, and one (Kees) was super-rude. He was shouting at passengers, not allowing to take place downstairs, doing his check-in with a sigarette in his hands, and telling people: if they immediately don't shut up, he'll stop the bus at the nearest gas station and set them out (i'm reciting directly). In general, he was EXTREMELY RUDE, something many times crossing the border of normal customer friendly communication. Also, he was announcing everything in Dutch, which is strange for an international bus route where most of the people were foreign tourists. I strongly think that these kind of people shouldn't work in the companies with a good reputation and customer-oriented, which I believe FLIXbus still is. I don't believe such people can change or undergo some training. It's character which don't change, so - my humble advice: just fire them and get normal people on job. The other driver, named Henk, was very nice and helpful though. When I explained that I'm having a medical operation for which I can't be late, he tried his best to make the bus arrive on time, even though the departure was 30 min late, while Kees was shouting that we can't demand anything from them.", 'stars': '2'}

{'review': 'If there are no delays, I would recommend the FlixBus. But if they are, then service works very badly. Last week I drove to Vienna from Leipzig with a transfer in Prague. Bus arrived in Leipzig two hours later. Every 30 minutes I called to the hotline and each time they said "it\'ll be alright". In this way, I was late for the second bus, already in Leipzig, I understood it and called the hotline. The woman was very rude, she spoke very loud and aggressive. She told me that I would not get any money back, but I could take a later bus to Prague without paying more. In Prague bus was also late. Then I went to the bus driver with my ticket, he told me that I was not allowed to come in. I explained the situation to him, but his main message was "there is no room left and he does not care". But bus was only half well, rather, he did not return my ticket in the hands, but he threw it. I had to go out and started calling the hotline. It did not make sense because no one answers. Bus closed the door and drove a few meters, then stopped, opened the door and driver called me, that I could come. But they can not understand with what aggressive voice it was said. Luckily I was already in Vienna in the morning. But it cost too much nerve.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': 'I know Flixbus from 2 views: The host of the almost daily at the bus station Prague waiting for his guests. In short: "Delays, undisclosed delays, neither station staff nor hotline know where the bus is". That\'s the norm for Flixbus for me. If it is more than 15 min. Delay is also happy to see nothing at all. Meanwhile, I ask my guests at the crew and ask me via SMS about delays to notify. Regiojet is more punctual, can inform about bus location and is more honest about delays. Complete cancellations of the journey have been made several times. Thanks Flixbus messed up the holiday. From the passenger: I am unfortunately used to the really luxurious Regiojet buses. In comparison, Flixbus means for me: 1. too short seat backrests 2. riders who are not able to find the bus station with a mobile phone service 3. delays 4. incompetent hotline. I have today on 31.05. at 21 o\'clock want to take the last Flixbus from Zittau to Prague. 20:54 clock was no Flixbus to see. At the bus stop on the Flixbusplan the bus does not arrive. Online shows "Bus is on time". Hotline says "today there is no bus, if he is late I can not see". Drove 21:15 clock by car and got the bus 40 minutes later on the highway. Either he simply made a turn around the stop Zittau or he left 10min too early. Good that I still had a car as an alternative.', 'stars': '2'}
{'review': "totally disappointed with FlixbusI had posted on May 28, 2017 a ride from Alsfeld train station to Frankfurt am Main. (Connection L113 direction Saarbrücken at 18:20 departure from Alsfeld.) I received at noon a text message that I should get on the bus A as probably several buses that day would drive the route ..... I was punctual 15 minutes before Departure, so at 18.05 clock at the station Alsfeld and waited and waited ....... until 20.15 clock! Next to me waiting for the same long time also a traveler who was waiting for the same bus ... so that 2 people, independently of each other, overlooked a poison green big coach from Flixbus seems to me very unlikely! The bus did not appear at all and I could not reach anyone on the hotline. It was an imposition. Out of sheer despair, somehow still coming to FRANKFURT, I approached strangers at the Alsfelder station, if someone could take me with them. A foreign lady agreed and requires € 50 for the take-away share of petrol. I arrived in Frankfurt completely unnerved shortly before 23 o'clock. On my complaint at Flixbus I received the cheekiest answer of all time: I would not have noticed the bus (which did not come) and Flixbus offered me a voucher for the paid ticket ..... just ridiculous. Should I stay now on the € 50, - I had to pay in private because the bus did not appear and I would not have come home otherwise?

{'review': 'The drive from Munich ZOB to Zurich HB with the X06 on 29.05.2017 was a pure impertinence. It all started when two Flixbus employees tried to explain to travelers without identity papers why travel was impossible. Both travelers were friendly and quiet. It would have been enough for a worker to clarify the situation. The other could have regulated the entry. All in all we got on the bus with 15 minutes delay. No welcome or safety briefing at the start. Also no apology for the late departure. After 5 minutes drive to the highway entrance in Munich we stopped at an Aral petrol station. There was no information from the driver nor was the vehicle refueled, as far as I can tell. A woman got out and did not return to the bus again. We waited about 20-30 minutes for the onward journey. Again no apology or information. The onward journey proceeded calmly and without congestion. Shortly before the transfer from Germany to Austria, we were stopped by a police patrol who had not asked us to follow. The bus driver had the patrol car several times from behind by means of high beam. There was no request from the patrol officers to recognize that we should have followed them. And again we stood next time. Despite the fact that there was no traffic jam and no traffic congestion, we arrived in Zurich with a delay of 1.5 hours. Also that there was no internet connection, was by the driver (wortkarg) with a word mentioned or excused. Quite different the driver on the way from ZH - Munich, who communicated nice and friendly. Unfortunately, I could not accept this delay because there was a risk of being stuck in Zurich. After missing two possible options to get to my hometown by public transport, there was only one last train home that I luckily reached (3 minutes before departure). First of all, I have enough of Flixbus and will in future switch to other alternatives and use them.', 'stars': '1'}

But there were nice people at the departure point in Leipzig, who told me at 15:15, that the bus will come in at least 1.5 hours. Since it was very hot that day, and there are barely seats and shade in Leipzig / Goethestraße, I had decided to cancel the ticket and drive with the DB. Unfortunately I could not cancel the ticket.

We were there at 12.50 at the departure sign from Flixbus. A FlixBus was ready, then drove to Berlin. We waited and waited. No Flixbus came anymore. At around 13.40 we called the hotline in Berlin.

You can do nothing -soory and bye I guess - another explanation I have not - that the bus was overbooked and in Prague the people on They all wanted to go to Nuremberg with this bus, but the bus drove via Zurich to Milano, which would be more important for Flixbus.Reservation: NEVER AGAIN FLIXBUS - an outrageous, rude and unhesitating bus company In the background, people could hear people laughing, we travelers did not think it was so funny. Flixbus\' excuse that we did not have the FD has started, has a legal background. Flixbus must write this, the burden of proof lies with the customer. Again: 6 people are at the departure sign - on time! There is no bus. 6 blind people? Meanwhile, I have heard of other concerned that with too few passengers the FAhrt ever fails - unprofitable.! You always have to reckon with Flixbus. As a severely disabled person (80%), I would have more rights. My wife is 50% disabled. But that does not matter with Flixbus.

Instead of 18:40 we arrive in Paris at 21h and the bus to Clermont-Ferrand is gone since 20:30 panic in the middle of the night in an unknown city. From 17h I begin to call customer service to explain the situation.

I turn to my driver that I suplie not to stop and notify the correspondence if it can wait. He tells me he will arrive before 20:30. He refuses to help me and call even at 20:30 I call the customer service who tells me the correspondence does not wait madam. Explain to me why his name is "correspondence" ?. So lost in Paris in a foreign country I remember the customer service and the lady tells me unraveled you take a train (train station by taxi to discover that there is no train to Clermont-Ferrand) customer service reminder. Answer wait 2am then take the bus from Lyon and Lyon you can go to Clermont-Ferrand or made as you see a yes bus. suitcase completely damaged I ended up finding a yes bus for 23 h. The next day I write to Flixbus who told me that they can only refund my original ticket of € 29.90 regardless of the damage suffered. Only 25 February to date I have received no refund despite telephone reminders by mail even via facebook. My question is where do you find your customer service staff to be so incompetent and disrespectful to customers? It almost feels like they hate their work. I had more than one person on the phone and I never had anyone acting as customer service from other sites. Last time it was a gentleman I had not finished explaining that he told me will send an email as if I had not done before hanging on to my nose (I\'m getting used to flixbus ) again. Not satisfied with torturing me mentally psychologically endangered physically by making me wander in the middle of the night in an unknown city or I never planned to go, spend on phone, metro taxi, he continues to disrespect me. phone and want to keep my money. The prices are attractive but as long as you do not risk losing your life through Flixbus\' fault, you do not realize how vicious they are, cruel, without the slightest computation for the client who claims to be "king". I continue to disrespect the phone and watch over my money. On facebook their team is nice, but concretely they offer no solution and do not even seek to find.

The actual arrival of 1030. On the legal request of 3 tourists - I and two others in Prague explain why you are late for us drivers answered we will take you on any day until 11.00. Of course, this surprised us and strained us. Flight to lyublyana number of cars Vz628. Very rude staff. There is no water in the toilet. After the bus moved to the toilet came an elderly woman. She sat in the toilet for a long time. Then I went in. I wanted pipi. I\'m a tourist, I was driving from Barcelona for 23 hours, imagine my tired state, I just made a quick pip to someone else\'s kaka and pressed the drain tank. To my great regret, there was no water ... After me came a woman and left. Then came the staff to the salon with a bottle of water and began to ask in an incomprehensible language the woman who came last to the toilet. she said something and the staff came up to me with an eggplant of water. I realized that they are asking me if I made kaka. at this point I had 2 options:) say that before me in the toilet was an elderly woman and point at it as pointing to me or not to offend / not to hurt the feelings of a woman taking "the blame for the action" on myself .... Behavior of staff it is not at all clear why to put the problem on display. The second you took money and lead people on a long journey and it is clear that people will use the toilet. It was necessary to eliminate the problem or pre-empt people that the toilet can not be used. It turns out after pipi or pda it is necessary at the driver to take an eggplant of water ..... In short, I was not very pleased. The company seems to be German but the staff is very bad. Not trained to solve small issues. Before I bought the ticket, I visited the site and I liked it.

{'review': 'I drove regular Flixbus in the past, the annoyed drivers, not always clean buses did not bother me so much. But the last experience has made me write this review. First, the payment system of Flixbus when booking via Sofortüberweisung a mistake reported, the money was debited from my account, I still got no tickets. I tried again, now everything has worked, the double debit will come back, I thought. After 2 weeks I can say - despite calls and emails nothing came back. The worst was then at the stop - because of the flight delay I was there very shortly before departure, about 2-3 minutes. With relief, I have seen there people who have been waiting for 5-10 minutes. All the more shocked we were all when we were told on the phone that the bus has gone away, "maybe 15 minutes earlier .." it said on the phone. So far I have not received any reaction from the company, i. Money debited twice, never driven once. Whether you want to do something like that?', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': "I took a trip from Hamburg to Copenhagen using Flixbus. The whole experience is just disaster. The first trip, from Hamburg to Copenhagen is about 1.5 hours late!!! In such a cold mid-night!!! And of course there was no mention of compensation or anything. The returning trip is the worst, I booked the bus which should directly go to Hamburg, but after I got to the station, I was told the bus I booked was full so I can only get on another one which will pass Lübeck and cost longer time, that was not the worst part of the trip, what happened next was even a little shocking to me how incompetent and disorganized this company is. I accidentally lost my whole luggage on the bus, after I realized that, the bus was already driven away! I immediately tried to call their customer service, by that time the bus was still on the road, about if they can help me contact the bus driver about my luggage, but they just refused to do that and told me I should go online and fill the form. And therefore, I lost my best chance finding my luggage, in there there are all my clothes and cosmetics which are costly! The day after that I nearly spent two whole days in the Hamburg ZOB trying to find some informations, I called the service line so many times, but no one was helpful at all. They refused to tell me about the details of the bus route and bus driver,  they refused to tell me about the bus partner which operates the line , they refused to tell me anything except that they just keep telling me to fill the form for which I have to wait 30 days for a mere response! After 2 days search I am really desperate and hopeless. I don't think I will ever choose this company again and I will share my experience with all my friends, Thank you Flixbus for ruining my holiday!

The driver was unbelievably friendly, he was well understood even though he did not come from Germany, he always kept you up to date and constantly said that you can use the USB ports with him to charge his cell phone or tablet. Also his driving style was great, you felt really safe. He had to take a break of 45 minutes and refuel once, which is why we finally got an hour late with the arrival in Hamburg (we did not get stuck in traffic). For me it was not clear whether the breaks were included in the FlixBus app or not (at the stop and time overview). A big compliment to the driver!

{'review': 'On Sunday I booked a trip to Prague and back and paid for the tickets with an immediate transfer. After the payment process, I should have some patience and wait 5 minutes. But nothing happened and after about 15 minutes I stopped. When I checked my account, however, the money was debited from FlixBus. After 1 day waiting and not receiving a confirmation email I called FlixBus. There I was told that no booking was received and I am not on the guest list of the bus. The lady on the phone also told me that the problem is known and I should just send a screenshot with the charge to the answer mail of the service. There I receive however for 3 days only automatic answers or no answers at all !!

{'review': 'As others also report here, I made an error message when paying by direct transfer. After entering all the data and making the transfer was on the screen that the page should not be closed and you should be patient and the transfer process can take up to 5 minutes. After waiting 30 minutes, an error message was displayed and the information that no money was deducted. This is not true. The entire amount was transferred. The order in the InternetBanking marked as carried out and reduced the account balance by the entire amount. First I wrote an email -> within a day no reaction. Then I called there. A call to the customer service, which has already begun with the quality of the line being extremely bad, did not succeed. There I was told that no booking under my name, my email address or my phone number can be found and you can not help me. I should once again make the same booking and once again transfer the amount. Of course, I rejected that. Thereupon the information that a remittance represents absolutely no problem and I should contact via email / must be because by phone, no solution is feasible. That is really extremely bad. As a company, Flixbus could immediately issue a credit and I would simply have booked the tickets again and redeemed the credit. Since my last contact two days have passed. No news yet. Not even an email confirmation. Nothing at all. Maybe I am petty, but I expect nowadays that if a payment transaction is faulty and the entire amount has already been transferred, that I am immediately on the phone contact and helpful and offers a customer-friendly solution and I do not have my whole story write once by email, send and then have to wait again, so that I get my money back. For me, this was the first and at the same time the last attempt to travel with this company. After all, there are already many alternatives. In other complaint boxes is also reported by exactly the same error and the same procedure. I expect that my entire transfer amount will be returned without any further delays.

{'review': "Hello Flixbus team, on a bus stop I've seen your poster, some destinations for only 9.90 euros. So I immediately decided to do a day trip to Budapest again. Was very pleased with you, easy booking, as well as friendly drivers and modern, as new buses with comfortable seating, Wi-Fi and power outlet for smartphones. And best of all, neither by train nor by car is this possible at such a price. The big advantage of traveling by car is that you can sit back comfortably after a great day of sightseeing and not have to drive home for a few hours at night. You can just get in and out of the bus without having to worry about parking your car. I had a wonderful day in Budapest with great weather.

{'review': 'Dear FlixBus Team, I write to you in the following concern: My friend has for the 08.04.2017 with the Flixbus a journey from Ravensburg to Munich (departure 07:10) and from Munich to Ravensburg (departure: 18:30 clock) for 3 Persons booked. The trip was pleasant and without complications. The return trip turns out to be a complete opposite. The reason for this is the following: According to the plan, we should arrive at 21:30 in Ravensburg at Escher-Wyss-Straße 9. We never reached this stop. The bus driver left us at 20:45 at Bahnhofsplatz 5. His reason: At the agreed stop too many people have to walk through the underpass to get back to the actual station. Unfortunately, several people (mostly women) sat in the bus because they had to walk exactly through this underpass due to the new location defined by the bus driver, because the car, bike, etc. were parked right there. There was no say. On my suggestion that we would arrive much earlier than planned, and it is quite possible to continue to approach the planned final stop before the time was answered with the sentence. "You\'re welcome to get out if you do not like it!". When I book a trip to a reputable provider, I expect to be dropped off at the agreed location. For that I have paid the travel price. It may well be a great gesture to let people out at another stop that is more convenient / more secure for you - but still the agreed destination should still be addressed afterwards. The passengers were not even asked in this case and we were allowed to walk with all the luggage through the underpass to the scheduled arrival. Based on the time of my mail, you can certainly see that we were let out much earlier than planned at the wrong destination. In itself, an earlier arrival time is no problem. But not, considering the way this was done: 1. The departure station Munich was left at 18:14 when the last registered passenger had checked in. A passenger was even forbidden to go to the toilet after checking in the last person, although the departure time is only 15 minutes later. The statement of the driver "then you have to stay in Munich, if it does not suit you" .2. Despite 30 minutes earlier arrival time in Leutkirch jumped the driver after leaving the last passenger with destination Leutkirch directly into the bus and drove off without asking. Had we not intervened in time, would a passenger who wanted to Ravensburg, there "sit" remained because he wanted to stretch his legs. Again, the bus driver fell only the sentence "we do not make fun event" ein.Ich personally have no problem with short breaks. But they should be arranged with the passenger so that everyone knows when to return to the bus. According to the plan, it could have been a 45 minute break. In this case, proceeding without consideration and examination. In no company so far have I been able to hear such a primitive expression of the driver as on this trip. This may also be due to the non-existent separation between driver and passenger, as is the case for example with the railway. However, this does not excuse the way in which the passengers communicate. 4. Had the driver had real interest in the well-being of his passengers, he would have, as already formulated above, the intermediate stop at the station street and would have then driven to the scheduled arrival. He would still have arrived 40 minutes before scheduled arrival. Due to the above points, I clearly question the professionalism of Flixbus. Sure, this may be an isolated case - but I\'ve never experienced anything like it. I have already reported my displeasure to the customer service (Ivona), who also wanted to leave a message from the relevant departments. I would not have spent the time taken by the driver to formulate this complaint. But a punctual delivery at the agreed place I would have been much dearer.Auch if this mail may cause nothing, I thank you for your understanding. Best regards from Ravensburg!

Not only with me, but also with three (!!) other passengers. Satisfaction is purposefully negligible here. Merry production of the luggage: the customer is allowed to take care of it himself! Only after a coworker came from the InfoCenter of Flixbus the situation could be settled with an additional payment (according to AGB). I did not have such a driver yet. If I would find several drivers like this one with Flixbus, I would also, despite the price / performance rather switch to the competition, even if that means spending more money. So in conclusion, if a FlixBus employee reads this message and does not care about a direct announcement to the bus driver, I\'m also ready to review this review or even remove.

Now I have asked him on the occasion also a document for an additional payment I made for luggage. He says that. Man, why did you say that in Zurich? Since when do you have to request documents for Bahrzahlung separately? He wants to give me a receipt on the ferry now. My only luggage that I have next to everyone else. In Zurich charged in Zenggsarbeiterverhältnissen, BTW weighs only 15 kg (weighed at Zurich airport). And is at the longest edge 77cm. Had I had two separate suitcases with 15kg each and 67cm each on the longest side + carry-on luggage, I would not have had to pay anything (no documents !!!!!). But that is the company policy and also stated. So I do not want to complain about that, however illogical it may be. Especially considering that you have to load it yourself. My concern is that he just pocketed the money and does not even ask if you need a receipt !!!!', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'ABZOCKE !!!!!!!!! On Monday the 27th of March 2017 I and my sister wanted to travel from Frankfurt Airport to Karlsruhe with FlixBus. We asked for the information and bought the tickets at the travel agency stand. For the tickets we paid 18 € + 10 Euro fees. The bus should leave at 16:15. We were already at 15:30 clock at the stop, with us many other passengers. The bus arrives punctually, but the bus driver has strangely only taken three passengers and said what should I do I do not have many seats available and drive anyway in the other direction and has made us in front of the door, one of the passengers hat even made his suitcase on the bus, which he barely got out of it. The bus driver said we should wait for another bus. Then we were still 45 minutes at the bus stop, another three buses have also rejected us and could not understand why the driver from the bus number 17 has not taken us. After a long phone call with the hotline, after a conversation with the travel agency stand you could not reimburse us, as well as give bus ticket for another bus. Travel agency lady said they only sell the tickets and unfortunately can not reimburse. Then call the hotline again, a woman Schengelia said she can not do anything and said we should write an e-mail to the company after a successful review, the cost will be refunded, because she has seen in the system also that other passengers as well have complained. The lady said we should look for another way as we come home today. Now at home several emails with the company, first they wanted to take no cost, then came an e-mail with a voucher amount 14 € instead of 26 € At the bus stop we had also met a lady who had such a similar experience, but from Frankfurt airport to Dusseldorf and said she has never been to FlixBus since then. So people conclusion total rip off !!!!!!!! Take care, well that we wanted to go home and not the other way around to the plane, otherwise it would have been a really good trip.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': 'I can hardly call a ride where something went right. If the bus is not late (30 minutes waiting time is seemingly normal, but sometimes it can be several hours - depending on which technical defect is on the list today), then there is a high probability that something else is wrong. The bus broke three times during my trips, so you had to wait several hours for a replacement bus at a service area. Although you get a part of the travel costs, the missed flights and appointments does not make up for it. The air conditioning is often set too cold in the summer, so you caught cold during 90% of the trips (but maybe you\'re lucky and it turns off completely), the toilet was completely closed on two trips, because the toilet was clogged, lost finds drive Often for weeks in the buses across Europe before they are finally sent to the lost property office and are ready to pick up. My phone came back after 3 weeks with a scratched and splintered screen. No explanation except "Flixbus is not liable for damage to found objects". Thank you too. With all these shortcomings is the non-functioning Wi-Fi the least problem. The prices, as cheap as they were a few years ago, are now also shot up, so you pay for a former € 8 expensive ride € 25 itself if you book a week in advance.

I booked it only under that condition and on their homepage they sell it like you can always take it with you. You have to book it extra though. Wanted to make it over email, since their hotline is a foreign number for me and expensive. Send them my request with booking number but got referred to the hotline.Called the hotline, 6min long, stupid and non helpful call! First I was told I would not be able to take my extra luggage with me because on that trip they are using a double-decker bus with cannot carry that (why not? and why do you even sell it on the website as if you could book extra luggage on every single bus) and then the lady was not able to help me further in any way nor able to refer me to a person that could maybe help me/knows more/has more responsibility. Instead she referred me back to the service email.... where I had just written a message before and waited for FOUR days for a response, referring me to the hotline...Do not make promises you cannot hold and have better ways of communication!!!!!Note: got a very fast reply this time just saying there is nothing they can do about it.Flixbus was ACTIVELY selling it as something like "go skiing, take your skiers with you and travel by Flixbus"- got that in an marketing email - SORRY but that is hilarious. You cannot use it for marketing purposes if you cannot live up for it!And on the internet they sell it with these words: "The advantages of taking FlixBus to go skiing✔ During winter, FlixBus offers bus services especially for skiers, snowboarders and other snow fans.✔ Frequent departures to the Alps and the Pyrenees from Paris and Lyon.✔ Modern and comfortable buses equipped with Wi-Fi and electrical outlets.✔ With three pieces of luggage included, you will have room for all your ski gear." Ewwww, screw you - there are NO advantages...One customer less FOR SURE!And what is very disturbing, when I am reading older reviews, this is not the first time happening!

The bus left at 15.25, and I wanted to start the transfer at 15.13 clock. Unfortunately, this could not be done, because I requested 3 minutes to change the booking too late. Oh well - I immediately called the customer service. However, he made the impression of sitting abroad and reading ready-made texts. I was with the sentence "I\'m sorry, if the bus has already left, it can not be rebooked" in the broken German fed. I could not believe that, since Flixbus still called customer-oriented, at least the management. So I wrote Flixbus on Facebook. Here I was told that I can somehow cancel it, minus cancellation fees. For this I have to contact a contact form. Again, you got miserable long texts that only partially respond to my question. Upon request, if you can answer my question now individually, you just meant to make me aware of the contact form so that I can assert my rebooking. OK! at least something. I described the problem again in the contact form. I thought, now it could work. I have described everything exactly, as well as here. And what came in response? I was presented with the available methods of payment & was told that I can download invoices for the tax office. Yes!

The booking was super easy and also by paying by PayPal everything could be booked comfortably and at a very pleasant price at home. The departure on Friday was a bit chaotic - unfortunately there were no announcements at the beginning of the journey (and the bus started at my stop). As a freshman, I would like to have some basic information about my bus trip. (Toilets, trash, other instructions such as buckle up, food / drink while driving, etc.) After about 45min drive I had to scare with GoogleMaps and find that the bus went in a completely different direction than the actual target. Other passengers noticed this and a courageous rider asked the driver and his companion. It was not until then that both drivers realized that they were completely wrong (despite Navi) because they seem to have missed the downhill. For me, the whole thing was really very disturbing, because I rely on the drivers knowing the track or Recognize it in a timely manner if they drive wrong and not only after being made aware of by the passengers. There were no announcements - it was turned only without comment, by this "random walk" was a delay of about 30 min.Die return on Saturday was great. The bus arrived a little earlier at my departure point - all passengers were the 15 minutes rather there & the bus could start even earlier.

Departure time would have been 9:30 and because it was constantly mentioned that you should be there 15 minutes earlier I did that and was punctual at 9:15 am at the bus station in Innsbruck like many other people. Then 9:30 - still no bus there, 9:45 - still no bus there and a notification via app came at some point where it said: "040: For operational reasons, the departure from Innsbruck will delay indefinitely. As soon as we have more detailed information about the new departure time, we will inform you immediately .. "bla bla - at 10:00 clock - still nothing and all were already very impatient. At 10:10 then I thought that it probably can not be and then called where a very nice staff helped me and said that apparently an extreme delay and I said then I have to make my flight and that is not and He then assured me that I should take the train and then get both refunded, the Flixbus ticket AND my train ride due to the enormous delay. Have hung up and you hardly believe it but then came to about 10:20 a Flixbus started and all were already full of hope and then we wanted to get on and then the bus driver in all seriousness did not let us board because he was the bus for 10:30 was !!!! Can you take that ?? Already over 1 hour in the cold stood and said ice cold - no I can not let you get in - really unheard of. But that\'s not all - then I\'m just on the way to the train made - 46.40 euro gone - (plus the 20 euro for the Flixbus of course!). I immediately sent the customer service a picture of the ticket as the gentleman told me on the phone how to do it and then came back the following answer: "It is important to us that you feel comfortable on board our buses and on time A delay (at departure) of under 120 minutes is by law in the frame and needs no refund of your additional costs.Your bus has left at 10.28 clock in Innsbruck and thus had only 58 minutes late.However, we will gladly refund you the fare of the unranked Flixbus ride in the amount of 19.50 € in the form of a voucher.

{'review': 'In itself I do not want to rate Flixbus negatively. I have always had punctual connections and clean buses. After yesterday\'s and today\'s trip, however, I have to tell you about my experiences with the drivers. Everything was fine on my trip to Berlin. The driver and another employee have talked a lot about private things, but that did not bother me. The return trip, however, was not acceptable in my opinion. It started at the Berlin ZOB, where we loaded our suitcases by hand into the bus\'s storage space (I did not know that from a previous trip, I was helped), but so far no problem. When the suitcases were then invited, the annoyed bus driver asked us "how do you know that the suitcases come there ?!". At our irritated inquiry, we got no answer until another employee, who stood next to the driver, asked us where we want to go. The driver then even more annoyed: "Yes ... then come in the back of the suitcase and not here in front!" Thank you for the kind instruction. After about 2 hours drive there was an announcement that we leave the highway to refuel at the depot just before Wolfsburg. "This takes about 10 minutes". In the end it was 30 minutes. The drivers changed, the previously annoyed driver was visibly friendlier and even said goodbye! After 2 hours driving we were told by the "new" driver what to pay attention to during the bus ride, that we can buy drinks etc. Nice to find out , Why not at the beginning of the ride? But the first exemplary impression deceived at the latest when we arrived in Hannover. The "new" driver cursing increasingly loud at the wheel, honked and cursed other road users as "IDIOTS!". Does this really have to be the case? I\'ll gladly use Flixbus again, but the drivers\' behavior, which I experienced today, is not sustainable in the long run.', 'stars': '3'}
{'review': 'No sooner have I arrived at the bus and kept my phone ready (so that the bus driver can scan the code) was his first sentence in one of me as very unfriendly sound perceived "luggage only on the other side".

I had a small travel bag and two handbags and my backpack with laptop, food and drink (to be able to work on the laptop during the 4 hour drive and drink) and then I was again pointed out in a very unfriendly tone I may just take a hand luggage with you on the bus. I thought ok then I have the other handbag in the trunk done. In the end, my handbag with valuables and my backpack with laptop and drinks stayed with me. He began to argue with me loudly and insisted that I may only get into the bus with my purse and that he would have taken away punishment from me but it does not make it out of goodwill. It was of course in my face an annoyed gesture to recognize and have out of anger "old!" said. There was even louder and threatened me with "I will not take you now!" which I find absolutely the greatest impudence and in my opinion, not at all! This is far from a customer-oriented service. Afterwards I have learned from other passengers that this bus driver (20.01.2017 departure 8:30 route: Bamberg to Würzburg) is apparently always very rude. Normally, I have always been extremely satisfied with flixbus (apart from delays) and driver behavior, but I am very disappointed with FlixBus\' "customer-focused" service and will not ride the FlixBus in the future!', 'stars': '1'}

We had shown up at the original pickup location (asked staff around if we were in the right spot) and no bus showed up. Our ticket had two portions as there was a small layover in a town. We decided to take a train to catch up to the next stop to reconnect with our bus. The train set us back 100 EURO! We showed up at the next stop. The bus was 15-20min late and then the bus driver would not let us board. We had a ticket for the first portion and second. However, their check in system would not allow the driver to check us in on his phone even though we could clearly see our names on his phone. We spoke with him and he laughed and did not allow us to board. We needed to get to our final location so had to pay 59 EURO to board a bus we had already paid for. I have spent 3 months now emailing (back in my home country now) Flixbus with only an offer to provide credit towards a new trip. I don't think I want to ever ride with them again. I want the Money back that was wrongfully taken from me as I already had a valid ticket for the journey. On top of that both the customer service agents and bus driver were very rude through the process and they just don't seem to care. The day that was meant to be fun and only cost us 45 Euro turned into a terrible experience and set us back the original cost plus 159 EURO. Could have flown to our destination for that!

Finally, I can say that a friend of mine sat in the bus which I then contacted and told me luckily he stayed on the climb as the bus arrived much earlier and left shortly before 20:15.

( my biggest mistake )At the border of france and England on the british side we were told to come out and have a passport check. When I finished my passport control and came out of the immigration centre, the bus was gone with all the passengers and with my luggage.HOW CAN HE LEAVE A PASSENGER AT THE BORDER, I called the same time to the bus service and they said that they don't have another bus to take me to London.I said them to atleast handover my luggage to my friend who was waiting at the London Victoria station and they said OK.But the bus did not arrive at the station and the managers at the london bus terminal has confirmed that and it is their in their records.the bus may be dropped the passengers somewhere close to the bus station and not in the ARRIVALS of the bus station.this is so unprofessional. I have a strong belief that the driver now stole my bags.I have written a complaint and been in touch with the customer center for the last 21 days and they say that they are still checking.I am in England without my luggage in a new country and they have little concern for customer and in general no feeling of sufferings of HUMAN BEINGS.They just don't communicate and don't care of the problems done by their company to others. they have no respect.I am not going to keep quiet for this because my luggage was all what I have in my life. I had two large bags and one backpack.I WILL VERY SOON APPROACH TO COURTS IF THEY DONT SOLVE THIS, I WILL EDUCATE PEOPLE, WRITE BLOGS, GIVE ADVERTISEMENTS IN NEWSPAPERS AND DO WHATEVER I CAN DO GET JUSTICE.I NEED JUSTICE, THEY ARE DENYING JUSTICE TO ME. 42 DAYS HAS PASSED AND THERE IS NO SINGLE COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMPANY", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'My Flixbus test report & experience. First of all: IF SERVICE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU, PLEASE MEET FLIXBUS! I have bought a ticket for the route Hamburg> Gdansk. In Berlin should be a change in another bus from Polskibus. The journey began suboptimal. I was late and was able to see my bus starting at 17:00. Quite clearly my fault. Next door was another Hal empty Flixbus, which drove to Berlin a quarter of an hour later. I described the situation to the younger lady from Flixbus who stayed next door and asked if my ticket could be changed to this bus at 17:15. She denied it energetically and referred me to the hotline. My advice, then the bus starts immediately and the hotline does not manage to help me in 15 minutes, she was not interested. I should buy a new ticket. Thought I could do it directly with the driver, but he referred me to the top floor in ZOB. I went there because the time was tight and it turned out that the tickets are only sold below. So I went downstairs again and bought another ticket for Hamburg> Berlin. Of course, twice as expensive and with processing surcharges. Back to bus run the Flixbuss lady ticket shown. The driver was a bit too bad to put my suitcase in the compartment and so I had to do it myself. Was actually only slightly delayed, but still drove off. Unfortunately, I was reluctant to feel and I have reported to the hotline to ask if my second ticket for the connection Berlin> Gdansk will be accepted. The lady at the hotline said no. I did not understand the explanation, but she said that even if I manage to get into this second bus on time, my ticket does not count anymore. The only solution is a new ticket purchase for the route Berlin> Gdansk. Questions about service / goodwill / concessions were abgewimmelt. So bought another ticket. Of course twice as expensive. So I have paid more for the outward journey than originally back and forth. I will abbreviate it here something and do not go into it: - that the hotline names are nice, but very poor German talk (no idea in which country the phone calls are diverted) .- that the bus toilet has dimensions of shoe box and the shoes are swimming in something yellow.- that the drivers seem to be very listless.- that SERVICE is a FOREIGN WORD on Flixbus.- that it was THE LAST TIME that I have the " The rating does not apply to Polskibus.

Ride 1 was from Enschede (Holland) to Berlin, Germany. There was a delay of 1,5 hours, of which we got informed 20 min after expected arrival time. After that, in Hannover, some people could not enter the bus because it was overbooked, they just had to wait for a new bus at 4 AM in the night.. The second ride I took is from Enschede (Holland) to Cologne, Germany, but unfortunately the bus didn't stop at the indicated station. So we waited for 1 hour, getting used to the delay already, and then decided to call. Turns out the bus didn't go to the station indicated.

{'review': 'The drive to Frankfurt was really great. I talked to a friendly rider well, read and barely felt the ride. The bus driver was almost fatherly. And he drove wonderful, calm and balanced. I had scheduled the return late, because I did not know how long I would need for my affairs in Offenbach. Unfortunately, I had only the choice between a bus at about 15.30 h and a bus at 20.00 h, because I had not additionally indicated Nuremberg as the destination. I am out of concern to miss my bus, have been on site early and stood there for about 4 hours. The breakpoint for the bus lines had been moved to the side street, because the bus station in Frankfurt is still being built. So I stood in a street where I did not get off. And some bus drivers had not noticed the change, so the employee of Flixbus repeatedly shouted that you should board the bus of line xxx at the other place. The buses were distributed in this side street about 250 m. But from behind it was impossible to see what a line it was. And when in the evening the nice lady did not work anymore, the people panicked completely and ran with children and luggage constantly back and forth. There was no seating except a narrow rim of window sill on a few windows of the street. And when I realized that my bus had left without me, I was treated extremely rude by a driver of the line 61, which should have taken me to the information of the hotline then. He could not speak German so well and said it was my problem and not his. He also refused to call back with the hotline. I once talked to a 028 bus driver and asked him if I was right with him. Probably the bus was going in the wrong direction, but I\'m not sure because it was the only bus that carried this number in the whole 4 hours. Not only was it bad for me that I could not ride the bus I had booked. I was also ablaafft by the driver of the line 61. And if not a nice young woman had the idea that I could ask the people from the Hello bus, because they would also go to Vienna, I would probably desperate. I then for 15, - EUR still on the bus of the company Hello. But of course we arrived so late in Nuremberg, that from Nuremberg no bus and no train left for Erlangen. Luckily I was picked up by my friend. But it really should not be like that. First, you might be able to offer a link through which you can also display the lines to the neighboring cities. Secondly, in such cities with a lot of bus traffic you should create seating and a better display of bus routes. Of course, a blackboard would be good. But in an emergency, it might also be enough if the respective bus attendant holds up a sign with the number, so you do not have to rush down the whole "platform" to find out if it is the right bus. I was scrounging for other people because they were not so good on foot with their children or heavy luggage. Many were also helpless because they could not read their ticket. Even I took a little while to find the number of the line there. And the number of the hotline was then barely recognizable even with the yellowish light of the street lamp even with reading glasses. I also found it extremely stressful that smoking was uncontrolled. Once I got smoked right from the left and right, so that I almost got my food back up. Of course, I can understand people that they have smoked more out of nervousness. But on the whole it was an intolerable situation. When I started in Erlangen it was sunny and beautiful. There was seating and a clear bus station. The only Flix bus, which rolled up, was then also the right one. The situation was relaxed and friendly.

The outward journey from Vienna to Prague with the Flixbus was still impeccable, because I can not fault it at all. The return trip I had to rebook for the reasons mentioned. So late in the evening I changed the ticket for the next morning 5:10 am via the app. We were at the stop at 4:50. At 5:10 o\'clock the Flixbus on the middle lane with approximately 50 km / h without stopping simply drove past the station. Call with the service hotline: After 10 minutes somebody takes off and tells me that this was not the bus to Vienna. This would unfortunately be delayed and would arrive in 3 minutes at the stop. We are so relieved waiting for the next bus. After 3 minutes actually enters a Flixbus, which also stops. We get in and show our ticket, whereupon the bus driver informs us that he is not traveling to Vienna, but to Stuttgart.Zweiter call to the service hotline: After 12 minutes takes off another employee. This informs me that the bus to Vienna is on schedule. The original assumption has therefore been confirmed, the bus passing us would have been our bus to Vienna. My assumption: Because we did not transfer until the evening before, the bus driver did not look at the current passenger list anymore and obviously assumed that there would be no boarding at this station (we were the only passengers at the station) and easy The reimbursement request (the refund was promised to me on the phone) was not responded until I forwarded an email to the service email address. It was an automated mail, after which my application is now being processed (why this does not automatically go out after receipt of the refund request is beyond me). After that radio silence. So I ask again by e-mail. After almost 3 weeks I get the succinct answer that the bus stopped on schedule. But at least I get a voucher for the unrisen Reise.I summarize: (i) the bus to Vienna does not take us; (ii) the first service employee says, the bus was only late and would like to put me on the bus to Stuttgart (iii) the second service agent says "of course" I get the fare reimbursed; (iv) it needs a request via the homepage and two separate emails to break the radio silence and after 3 weeks get the answer that the Bus was stopped there and therefore the fare is not refunded. I then complained again, whereupon I was informed that (i) the bus lt GPS at the specified time has held there and even someone has entered and (ii) my application with a duration of almost 3 weeks anyway was answered extremely fast, because the standard processing time is 4 (!) Weeks. What should I say, a classic case of statement against statement. I can only take note of that. I have documented with photos (this also sent to Flixbus), where exactly we have been waiting (there even the Flixbusfahrplan was appropriate, on which also our bus connection was listed). If they say, GPS was the bus at the designated stop and somebody got in, then I was actually too stupid and waited in the wrong place, or the bus stopped somewhere else (although it\'s amazing, that afterwards the bus to Stuttgart stopped right there, the timetable hangs there and the driver told me on the way there, that the bus leaves for the return trip there (I asked him when getting out) .I leave it here and will be easy I would still like to tell you another "delicacy" (= Gustostückerl) In the second answer from the customer service, they have made me aware that I should also pay attention, for the ride only paid 5 euros anyway because I have redeemed a voucher of EUR 30 for the ride, what exactly do you mean to say that I have the 35 euros voucher granted me for another trip I must be glad, because I would have received only 5 euros for a reimbursement, if 30 euros of the journey with a voucher were paid? Well, I would say, I have previously bought the voucher (if you rebook, you have to cancel and get for the canceled trip a voucher which you can then redeem when booking the new trip).

{'review': "First of all, I have to say that in the past I have often driven with Flixbus and was always very satisfied with price / performance. My last drive, however, was a minor disaster. The bus had a breakdown shortly after the stop in Reutlingen. The bus driver did his best to organize a new bus and driver etc. On the part of Flixbus, he could only be helped very late. Finally, we sat over two hours in a broken bus ... There were no alternatives (as about to change to train) offered what especially for guests who wanted to go to Munich was very annoying. Finally, we arrived with good 3 hours late in Stuttgart. That happens, no question, synonymous Flixbus can not big what the breakdown, but how during the breakdown and after dealing with customers is impossible, which is why I write this review here because you probably heard more here. First, I had the customer service Called, they told me it must be discussed with the team leader, what you get as compensation for the significant delay and I would then receive an email. After 3 days still no mail ... Called again and I was told that only by direct mail contact run and I would have to write an email in which I describe the case exactly. Done directly. After a week, an automatic response in which is apologized for the late response and hope that the case has done in the meantime .... Yes, no, he has of course not. I have called again and I was told it takes about 4 weeks It is now 6 weeks ago and I have not received any answer / compensation or similar. I have to say that since then I have really lost the desire to drive with Flixbus and lately and probably in the future more and more to train or car will change, because I'm tired of running out of money or the like and even so much Time must be put into something where you had already lost 3 hours unnecessarily in a bus. One is only deviated by the customer service .... From email contact referenced on phone and vice versa and no one seems to feel so responsible for the cases ...", 'stars': '2'}

{'review': "Update (January 2017): Even after a further 6 months still no solution through Flixbus. Emails are simply ignored. The customer service is miserable. When I drove to Berlin about two months ago, I drove for the first time in a long time with Flixbus again. The prices are indeed in comparison to a flight or train driving already very tempting. At first I was very positive, everything seemed very efficient, although we were a little late, but I thought to the cost savings, you can take that into account. I already told some of my friends how great Flixbus is. But then came on the return journey to Konstanz the angry awakening. When I arrived in Konstanz my luggage had disappeared from the storage room. Value well over 500 EUR. The following points suggest in my view that the loss of luggage was ultimately caused by Flixbus personnel: 1. In a telephone call with the Flixbus customer service I was told that normally the baggage is sorted by the driver sorted by departure depending on the destination, so that there is no misunderstandings when clearing out. This was not the case in Berlin. There the driver did not give any luggage, this was done by every passenger.2. The driver of the section from Munich to Konstanz has informed me that the luggage space was empty when he took over the bus in Munich and he obviously (for a reason I did not see) was emptied by Flixbus staff, with my backpack not cleared back has been. The driver also informed me that for longer stays it is recommended to take the luggage out of the bus and then give it back. This was also not communicated to me before. Now it is not over. A mistake can always happen, especially since the drivers have a noticeably high pressure. The real sad thing about the story was the subsequent contact with the customer service. First, I had to wait almost two weeks until I was informed by the lost property office that my luggage has not appeared in Munich. Why this lasts two weeks is beyond me. No further comments, nothing. Upon further inquiries, I was finally asked to inform me about another request via the contact form on the website for damages. There I described the exact situation, attached a list of the lost luggage items with value and then simply also on several queries NOTHING more of Flixbus heard. That's over 6 weeks ago. Even on telephone inquiries is simply abgewimmelt with the excuse that there is no contact person with whom could be connected, I could only submit my requests via the contact form. That brings me a lot if these disappear in Nirvana. The really sad thing about the story is that Flixbus is a company that would have had a lot of potential in my eyes, but sooner or later it will fail. It did not understand that in today's world, a company will not have a long-term existence that treats or ignores its customers. Low prices ok, we all want them, but then better 10% on it and make sure that a minimum amount of customer service is maintained. So Flixbus will sooner or later be able to hold only those customers who are absolutely dependent on the low prices. Customers who have the choice, like me, will fall back on other options and dodge competitors (which will sooner or later certainly give it back because they are invited to such a service deficit in the market!) With me Flixbus has now lost a fan or almost a brand ambassador. I had already raved about Flixbus as I said and recommended it to my friends and yoga course participants. After this experience I have to strongly advise against Flixbus, at least for longer distances with intermediate stops. At least until such problems are solved more professionally. I probably continue to drive on short distances where I can travel without luggage.", 'stars': '1'}

After contacting our bus driver 2 hours before our original arrival time (to make sure we could reach our connection from flixbus in Antwerp), we were assured that all measures were taken to guarantee our transport to Groningen.However, on arrival there was nothing to assure this and our busdriver left us behind. After not being able to reach Flixbus for two times 15 minutes, we were told by a busdriver (Flixbus) to have some food and try again later. Later also did not help and we were left on our own for 1,5 hours after which we had to arrange our own stuff to try to reach our destination.Furthermore, we tried to cooperate with 5 flixbus drivers. All of them told us to 'f... off'. And one driver who didn't know I spoke Dutch, insulted my girlfriend and issued discriminating slurs based on her ethnicity and religion.After having extensive email contact (around 15 emails), 5 phone calls and 3 times the exact same assurance that our payment would be taken care of (earliest about 2 months ago), we still have not received any compensation.Furthermore, Flixbus only takes into account compensation for extra travel costs.

{'review': 'Last week I took Flixbus from Amsterdam to Leverkusen. Unfortunately, the behavior of the driver in no way corresponded to the quality of service advertised by Flixbus.1) When boarding I should stow my luggage (a small backpack) according to the driver under all circumstances in the luggage compartment. Even when I pointed out that I was allowed to take the backpack on the way with ease on the bus and he contains many personal valuables, I was merely insulted, "probably not read properly", it would eventually be all in the guidelines , Quite apart from the fact that the open luggage space is not monitored by anyone (which Flixbus does not care, they are not liable for lost luggage), I thought it was a bit strange, as both the passengers in front, as well as behind me with their backpacks were allowed and these were sometimes much larger than mine. 2) As I got out of the car, I realized that a passenger sitting in front of me had left something behind. It was a very valuable headphone. When I wanted to give the piece to the driver, this was only to understand that he did not care what happened to it and I should just keep the headphones for myself. Overall, I can recommend these events and similar testimonials of other passengers to anyone with Flixbus, Mein-Fernbus etc. (now almost everything belongs to them). I always thought train driving was frustrating, but Flixbus sets there again a drauf.Zur answer from Flixbus here below the following: I had already written to you and described the above points in detail. I also asked you to locate the owner of the headset. But there was only a "standard answer", which suggests that my mail was not even read.

{'review': 'These bus drivers had no orientation when we arrived at the airport. Despite signs "Terminal 2 straight" the bus driver turned right into the outdoor area. He looked stunned at the hall of DHL, which was far away from Terminal 2. The angry passengers warned the bus driver that he should finally drive to Terminal 2. It was very close with the checkin. Instead, the bus driver got out and ran about 50 meters behind the cleaning staff. The cleaning staff did not know where Terminal 2 is. A passenger went into one of the buildings independently, where no employee was found. The passengers were now so annoyed and loud angry, because we had lost by a traffic jam just 1, 5 hours already. When changing the driver at a rest stop, the bus driver stared so stupidly in a queue waiting at the taps, although 2 rows were only 2 cars. After waiting for 15 minutes, the bus driver finally noticed that the other ranks allowed a continuation of the journey. After the bus driver still did not know how he should get from the DHL hall to Terminal 2, he drove on good luck in the next street. Now it was enough for all passengers. He was asked to open the doors. 5 passengers got into a taxi to reach the check-in. All other passengers were wandering in the open air to get to Terminal 2 somehow. I myself found by chance the 800 meter long way to Terminal 1, there to the shuttle bus to Terminal 2 to climb.

We have reached the city punctually on time, but in the Rushrour against 17:00 but a few minutes longer needed to the ZOB, as planned.

Then a stranger was so nice to shoot me the money, which offer I embarrassed enough to accept. All this while the bus driver kept looking at me dirty, yelled and the flixbus scan employee stood there like a salt bag and shrugged his shoulders. Have never been treated so rudely.

{'review': 'To be insulted by a bus driver, you only experience that at Flixbus. Many say the service on Flixbus leaves something to be desired. No wonder, I always thought - at the dumping prices you can not really expect much. But what I experienced from Vienna to Munich on Monday, on the way to or before the start of the journey at 17:15, still leaves me speechless. It all began with waiting customers who behaved well enough to show their ticket to the bus driver. An obviously bad-tempered bus driver replies my "hello" only with an ice-cold "ID". That\'s what I call a good start to a common 6-hour trip: giving the customer a feeling, as if he has just committed a crime. Well, thank God, it goes even further. Delivered suitcases with colleagues, I ask them if I should take the Zara shopping bag with 2 jackets on board or he stows them in the luggage compartment. "Just take it with you" answers this friendly. Said done, I climb the bus and hear after felt 3 steps a "Hey Sir". Amazed, I turn around and see an angry bus driver who really yells at me "What\'s that? That belongs downstairs ". Meant was my shopping bag with 2 jackets. On my answer that the colleague said I should take this on board, follows the next blow. "Then stash them in the jacket pocket and woe dangle a sleeve or something." Perplex as a 34-year-old marketing manager to be treated like a "stupid" schoolboy, it\'s enough for me now and I answer the bus driver "Certainly not in this tone". Not a good idea, I noticed at the same moment. Because this is followed by a "That\'s enough!" And the bus driver rips the shopping bag out of my hand and hands it over to my colleague. In order not to escalate the situation further, I decide to let it pass through my mind - but ask for the name of the bus driver to officially complain about him. "You certainly will not get it. Just write Flixbus from Vienna to Munich at 17:15 "replies this cynically. Well, enough, I think, to find the "blackest of all sheep among the bus drivers". As I open my MacBook to begin my complaint, I hear the bus driver cursing in the background. "We already know that. Big mouthpiece and nothing behind it "or" At Flixbus, the driver still decides who can ride and who can not. "Are a few of the niceties that fall. Stunned by the incidents, I wonder where I just landed. And then I remember: Welcome to Flixbus.', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I decided to try Flixbus for a chance with the nightbus between Copenhagen to Rotterdam, but will never travel with them again. First off, the bus (Together with 2 other Flixbusses with different destinations) was delayed by 45 minutes. Because we still had to get onto the bus aswell, we ended up leaving far too late.The promised internet was availible on the bus, but wasn\'t working. After politely asking the bus driver if he could help getting it to work he replied whilst smiling, and I quote: "Flixbus probably doesn\'t have the money to pay for the internet connetction to work on this bus, so I won\'t be able to help you with that". During the drive, the temperature in the bus rose to 26 degrees celcius. After repeatedly asking to turn the temperature down(by multiple passengers), finally they agreed to change the temperature down, only to let it rise back up to 25 degrees again about an hour later.Following to that, we stopped twice unnecessarily. We stopped, the busdriver got out, walked to a private car, and started unloading food, drinks and other personal stuff from the car into the bus, only to unload all the stuff again into another personal car, after we had crossed the Dutch border for the second unnecessary stop. This delayed the trip by yet another 30 minutes whilst passengers were waiting in the bus. As far as I am concerned Flixbus is in passenger transportation, and NOT a glorified goods transportation company, but I might be wrong...After 2 extra unnecessary stops and a total of an hour delay, the busdriver thought it to be nessasary to stop an aditional time just 1 hour outside of Amsterdam, because, and I quote again "He felt like drinking a coffee". After several passengers complained about the delay, he told us to "just call the costumor service if we didn\'t like it".In summary the service provided by Flixbus was appaling. The bus arrived 45 minutes late, the promised services (such as wifi) wern\'t working, we stopped unnecessarily 4 times(on top of the compulsary driver changeovers) and arrived over an hour and a half late. I will skip Flixbus from now on and stick to companies that actually deliver such as EuroLines.', 'stars': '1'}

Then we continued our journey at our own expense. Also on the return trip there were serious problems. We were half an hour before the announced departure at the Flixbus stop in Kornwestheim. The bus should leave at 20:35. Since after half an hour still no bus came, I tried to call the hotline. Unfortunately, I only got the announcement that all staff are busy and I should call later. I tried to reach Flixbus until about 21:15, unfortunately unsuccessful. We have at the time of booking a mobile phone number to get in case of a delay or similar notice. Again, nothing was communicated to us. We then through other guests who also waited for the bus, that the connection fails. Then we ran to the station to come back to Augsburg at their own expense.

{'review': 'The trip to Berlin was my first trip with such a company. The late departure was acceptable, as well as timely feedback came on the phone.

In case of cases the bus driver would have had to park the bus in front of Berlin! However, because of his experience, it has still worked. Since the route is very congested, this problem is well known, should not be waived here at the expense of the dissatisfaction of the travelers on a second driver. The price of 9.90 € is very tight in my opinion and it should be "reasonable" prices. A flight for 25 € to Mallorca is also not OK. The bus was okay so far, the driver was at least in the beginning in a bad mood (something I had seen the day before in a television report, there was a positive and negative gelaunter bus driver shown) , I hoped on my day of traveling on a good-humored driver ...

The company and its infoline do not understand the difference between an airport transfer and a regular stop. Passenger aircraft accepted and accepted a slight delay in departure due to the delay of the aircraft because everyone can meet it. This is how the Aiport transfer works. If Flixbus does not understand it, it is better to remove the Berlin TXL stop from the distribution and return to the flexible airport transfer. The price of the ticket (Berlin center - 7 Euro, TXL-11 Euro) indicates that Flixbus distinguishes passengers from the airport for an additional fee but does not give anything in return.

An hour later, I and three other passengers still sat in Dusseldorf - no trace from the bus. We had spent the hour checking every incoming bus for its number and destination, as the first bus (marked with our number) , who reportedly came as a night shift from Berlin, with the words "I give no information, I have to leave work, leave me alone" abfuhr.Nachdem I called the hotline and I was told that the bus was allegedly 45 minutes late and travelers had checked in (where, in Cologne?!

I also wanted to cancel the return trip - via the Internet portal that was no longer possible (allegedly the order had already been canceled). Conclusion: missed out on the way Called twice with FlixBus, heard twice I have to contact the company by email because the phone service can not refund - and until today I have not seen a cent.

The driver was not very accommodating and said he had never seen the bag, which still makes me very angry, because his job is to load and unload the luggage. After much back and forth, we were then led to the Flixbus stand inside the station and a very courteous lady with good knowledge of German tried half an hour to find out where the bag could be - in vain. We decided to drive to the main train station to find out for yourself if maybe someone with the wrong bag got out. I was really shaken when, after more than an hour of complete insecurity and foraging, I saw the sports bag standing alone on the curb beside the road (where the bus had stopped). It was pure luck that the bag was still there and above all, that nothing was missing. An impudence to unload the luggage without making sure that it is also someone who has dropped out, and just let it stand. For this reason, the trip has unfortunately not earned more than 2 stars. Had we not found the bag of its own accord and by accident, we would probably never get it back, because the driver denied to have seen the bag.', 'stars': '2'}

When I saved the booking, I then found that the date was wrong (departure at 1am, which means I accidentally booked one day early). The customer service then told me you can not help me, the ticket is neither refundable nor rebookable. I can understand that offers are not repostable, but that one is immediately stamped in case of errors in the booking, I think harsh. So far I have taken Flixbus twice, both times at night the route Rome-Munich. For someone who is 1.90 tall, the comfort is zero. Internet on the bus is advertising technology a great idea, but for me it has never worked properly (but was expected). I also do not understand why people have to take off their shoes even though it says in Arabic that they should let it. Ergo: if you are short of money, really have no choice and have to book at the last moment, buy a ticket on Ebay and take Flixbus (but be careful when booking). Otherwise, booking an early plane or train is often cheaper and much more comfortable for long distances. Hello Carlos, good to know Flixbus apparently has staff who do nothing but answer ratings, even on Sunday. The voucher was not a gift, I think I have the right to the promised performance for which I have paid, albeit indirectly. Rebooking is one thing, help with booking another.

The bad thing happened afterwards. I have repeatedly called the customer service and rarely came through, which is a joke with a paid hotline. Unfortunately, a transfer to a connecting bus that I would reach was no longer possible, I would have had to wait 7 hours for the next ride (which was not possible, because I had to go to a job interview). I was kindly promised by a customer service representative and her supervisor. Flixbus will cover the costs of the train journey for the remainder of the journey. The next day, I sent all documents required to cover the costs (in the original) by post to the Flixbus central office. Approximately 8 weeks after sending, I kindly inquired about the whereabouts of my money. I was put off by the fact that my documents had been received, but the processing took much longer.

Arrived in time in Nuremberg, I had about one hour big window and went to the main station, but was already 20 minutes before the departure time at 6:50 at the bus stop on Willy-Brandt-Platz (where I had previously arrived, also as a ZOB known). When the bus had not arrived at 7:15, I started to worry, because I was not allowed to delay too late not to miss my flight. Call the customer service quickly to find out how long the bus should be late. To my surprise, I was told (and thus also another passenger, who was waiting with me) that the bus to Munich Airport is happily driving and that I missed the bus (which is impossible, as I am in the time window 6:30 - 7 : 15 was in place). Since this explanation of the client advisor obviously did not correspond to the fact, I can only guess what actually went. I hope for Flixbus that it was a delay that was not properly handled by the system. Otherwise that would mean that the bus simply did not drive up to the stop in Nuremberg. So much for this ride.

The young woman looked at me then only very stupid and ignorant, put me the business card and told me to call there. I tried to call 42 times and I was not put through. For that it should be an alleged 24h service, that was below the belt. Desperately, I drove to my actual vacation spot on the subway. Once there, I filled out the form for lost items on the Internet and sent it off. A little later came an email that is taken care of and I will be notified shortly. And the hint that it can take up to 30 days. 30 days. And on vacation. The notification coming soon is still not there. The next day, today, I called the hotline again and was put through after 5 minutes. The lady on the phone told me then also, I would have to fill out the form and everything would go its course, so about 3-4 weeks. Although she can not help it, I have left out my displeasure. Now I am in Hamburg on vacation and things. Money etc was of course in my purse, I have it with me. And yet, I have somehow nothing. At this point I would like to allow me the tip that it should be made possible that the bus driver in the control of the luggage compartments, not picked up bags and suitcases at the respective stop or at the station.

Apparently bookings through iDeal do not come through at Flixbus, but mysteriously the money was deducted from my bank account anyhow. Two days later I realised I never received a ticket, so I called customer service. They told me to purchase a new ticket with a creditcard OR directly from the bus driver, because iDeal doesn't work and they didn't receive my booking. Why do you provide this payment method if you know it doesn't work? This information was also sent to me in an email. Since I was travelling the next day already, I decided to go for the latter option. When I arrived the next day, the bus driver told me I had to pay extra for the ticket because I didn't buy it online! So I had to pay 33 euros instead of 19 euros for one way. I coulnd't believe it, but I had to take that bus and he told me to contact customer service again. Flixbus technical problems are not my fault and they should have told me I had to pay extra, otherwise I would have purchased through creditcard! I sent them several emails with all the information they requested, but I never heard back from the customer service.

{'review': "I got convinced to try Flixbus for the low fares and for what looks to be a serious company. The issues encountered actually explained why and how they can afford offering these low fares at the beginning.First of all, you can't (at least for the lines I chose) buy open tickets, you are fixed to a defined time and price... and departure places. The problem is they are plenty Flixbus buses leaving at the same time and long story short, it's easy to miss your bus even if you are on time and wait at the right place. Then you need to pay an overpriced ticket at the bus driver for the next bus. Try to discuss with their employees onsite, bus drivers and personal? They have zero understanding, don't all speak english, have no decision power and when I managed to get a proper conversation with one of them, he admitted this was a known issue having tourists missed their bus and paying an overpriced ticket, also admitted this was frequently reported internally...

The bus driver was friendly and helpful and when all the other passengers boarded was also immediately started. The ride over was really relaxed there were only very small mini jams but these were quickly overcome. But then just before Hannover where the second stop would be, the bus turned to a gas station and the driver left the bus to look at the driver's side to anything. He took pictures which amazed me and then hastily phoned. We passengers looked weird then and the phone call took about half an hour. But when the bus driver got back on the bus and explained what was going on I fell off the chair. The bus driver told us that he had just phoned his boss to report to them that the bus front had a puncture and it would be better to organize a replacement bus. But the boss had told him on the phone that everything was fine with the mature and he should not do so. I as a passenger and also my companion did not feel well at all because of something like that and also some passengers said that they would get off here. The bus driver tried to calm down and said that he would drive under 80h / km and would immediately stop driving, should the ride of the bus deteriorate. Said we drove on and when we reached Hanover with already much delay, we kept hearing how our bus driver with the customer center on the phone. Finally arrived in Hanover, our bus trip was canceled first but it should already be a replacement bus on the way to take us to Hamburg Hbf. Nevertheless, we thanked the bus driver because he had really done the best job in the whole company and waited for the replacement bus. This arrived after 30 minutes but when we wanted to get in, the lady told us that she knew nothing about the whole thing. Immediately the cell phone was picked up and the lady called at the head office and let us get on the bus. So we finally drove on and reached Hamburg central station at 22:00 o'clock. Although according to the timetable we should be there at 18:45. But we were all just happy to have arrived at the end and were also with the nerves at the end. Nevertheless, I can only praise the bus driver who really had done everything in his power to us to move to Hamburg. I love Chef's the Flixbus Businesses, can YOU still sleep right through when they are so easy to deal with strangers by telling YOU that everything is alright, ONLY so you DO NOT have to spend the money to make sure the buses are in order? It is an impudence to behave in such a way and above all, that you are on the verge of passing over what happens to your customers, as well as with your driver?

If you have a refund request or a faulty booking that you want to cancel (the booking system is not mature, especially with previously purchased Lidl vouchers for Germany-wide trips) then you get 2 weeks no answer, even if you send the mail 3-4x over several days, it is based on gross ignorance and only if you "pressure" and sets a deadline and threatens with legal fees then you realize that the customer service reads the emails every hour but very quickly, sometimes even within 10 minutes intervals, but then only tries to talk the customer out of claims, everything is so "bent" so that the customer receives no credit / refund. Basically, money is not given back for faulty tickets, even if this is against German law. At the end I filed criminal charges for *** against Flixbus / Meinfernbus, one is deceived as a customer and it is only about the avoidance of claims of the customer. No Euro should go back to the customer. The procedure runs against Meinfernbus / Flixbus ... Conclusion: Customer service of the above merged companies (both service departments are probably closed together, same procedure) is only to defend against claims ... even the Deutsche Bahn is much more customer-friendly and accommodating with problems and sticks to most the law. Will look in the future rather early for low rates at the Deutsche Bahn or looking for long-distance bus companies to offer the service, because it quickly goes wrong something when booking and otherwise the money is gone ...', 'stars': '1'}

The bus arrives from Mainz in Frankfurt. Say, the driver has already driven about 45 km by bus. In Frankfurt, after all have boarded, the driver notices that he has no cooling water. The ride will not continue. It is waiting 2.5 hours for a replacement bus. This is again too small, so that another replacement bus must come. In the three hours you\'ve been waiting for, you were allowed to stay in the heated bus, but you should not leave it to buy something to eat or drink, because the replacement bus could come at any time. According to the Passenger Rights Regulation, in such a case assistance is available, which was not offered (can be read in the EU Regulation 181/2011, published on the homepage of the company). Otherwise, I could speak of numerous other incidents. Every time I rate the ride and it actually changes nothing. But as long as I can travel cheaply, I accept it. If the bus trips are more expensive, then I will have to use other transport options.', 'stars': '3'}

I always drove with Berlin Line Bus and saw the great cheap offer from FlixBus (22 €) and thought that I was driving with me. First impression was first an unfriendly, barely German speaking bus driver. I had to stow my suitcase myself, so I did not know about BLB so I was amazed. The impression of the bus itself is positively nice clean and well maintained but that is also the only positive. Then the bus driver has shown this little film what you have to consider, etc. Among other things, it was said that you can get snacks at the bus driver? But it was not said if standing or driving so I go out of both times and I find it violent that you can get snacks while driving the driver. He has to focus on driving and not on selling snacks. Should it not be allowed while driving then this should be mentioned anyway. Conclusion: I will not go on vacation with FlixBus again. I'd rather pay a few euros more at BLB and that's what customer service is all about! So for students who want to quickly from A to B, I find the completely arrangement but not to go on vacation. PS.

{'review': 'I travel a lot with Flixbus, several times a month, usually. the route Dresden-Berlin. On the whole, I am satisfied. Most of the buses are modern and comfortable, equipped with outlets and (reasonably) working Wi-Fi and the toilets are fine. Now and then is sometimes an older model here, often as a replacement bus, then unfortunately often without, or with retrofitted sockets on top of the luggage rack, which is quite impractical, but at least, and then mostly without WiFi. Unfortunately, I already had a completely broken or heavily worn seat belt 3 times and from time to time you can not adjust the backrest (anymore). 10Min late departures are quite common, probably. 50%, but I do not think so bad. Lately, unfortunately, the significant delays of 30/45 minutes and more (more congestion due to summer holidays?), In more than half of the cases without notification by SMS or staff, which of course, especially at the high temperatures at present (07 + 08/15), and, at least at the stop Dresden Hbf, where there are no shadows or seating, is extremely annoying and sometimes seriously harmful to health. With a corresponding delay message you could at least go somewhere in the shade, but if you do not know when the bus leaves you unfortunately have to stay there. The riders are usually very friendly and all drive absolutely neat. In principle, I find that there is a snack and drink offer (in most buses), but that one must distract by the purchase of the / the driver * during the trip, I think rather not so good. Maybe the concept can be reworked a bit I would like to improve: 1. More frequent control and, if necessary, replacement of seatbelts2. (shady) seating at the stops (Dresden Hbf. and Neustadt!) 3. Improvement of WLan bandwidth and reception "on the flat land", and activation of YouTube;) 4. In the app under "My Tickets" canceled tickets should disappear from the list, which can be rather confusing;) 4. In addition, I would like even more barrier-free buses, even if it does not concern myself. Some are already on the international lines, but there can still be more, because even people with physical impairments want to be mobile. And it should also be marked on the Internet or in the app, whether a particular bus is barrier-free or not.', 'stars': '4'}

In the course of the booking process of Flixbus, the mobile number is queried so that you can be notified in case of delay via SMS. Today I had made extra work two hours earlier to catch the 16:25 Flixbus to Hamburg. The display at the ZOB, Hannover showed a delay of 40 minutes. I had not received a text message about the delay, just as on Friday of the previous week when the Flixbus had an hour delay. By SMS, I was only informed about the appearance of the bus. After waiting for 40 minutes, I asked the Flixbus employee with the artificial fingernails and black hair (unlike her colleague, she did not want to say her name, was she ashamed of Flixbus?), Call the head office to ask when the bus would arrive finally at the ZOB is. I had heard from other guests that the delay would actually be 1.5 hours. Absurdly, she was only allowed to call her control center after another 10 minutes delay, she let me know. The bus she could not track, the navigation device was probably broken. Neither did she call me a responsible person, nor did she let me call someone in the control room who was responsible for the information chaos. She just referred to the customer service and claimed that the bus was right there. Meanwhile, the 16:15 Flixbus to Hamburg, which was also late, arrived in Hannover. With a burning cigarette the bus driver ran through his bus! Although there were still places available, he was not allowed to take along the passengers waiting for the bus at 4:25 pm. (At Lufthansa it\'s different.) There was no substitute bus provided. Finally, the delay was 1 hour and 40 minutes. Although our bus driver had already informed the control center about the delay at noon, the passengers were misled with a delay of 40 minutes. An SMS with the actual delay, we did not get. Also on the website there was no hint. Delays of buses can happen through accidents and traffic jams, I had already experienced in the previous week. What annoys me so much is the lack of information or the misleading by false information.

Again, caution is necessary !!! - The worst was the hotline was not even available. After 2 minutes you were always kicked out of the hotline. Even after about 20 try !!! I think as far as customer service is concerned, you can still be more customer-oriented here! Conclusion: The price / performance ratio is good. And the buses very well equipped. There is probably also buyable food and drink at the driver to acquire this I did not claim. What I personally was very happy was that due buses run really quiet like a ship on still waters and that it was nice and warm in there. Caution is advised when booking! The who e.g. As I booked bulky luggage only for one person gets to cancel only cancellation fees and coupon codes for the next trip! Therefore, make sure to book time and double check if everything is booked correctly then you have a nice ride at a good price :-)", 'stars': '3'}

I have often raced with FlixBus, with mostly positive experiences, but I was very shocked by a situation where the bus driver was out of tune on 04.02 Has. I drove from Osnabrück with the 17:45 clock bus to Hamburg and had to notice how the bus driver his bad sense not only on me, but also on the other passengers, left out.

I waited with other people in the blazing sun for the 16:25 and 17:45 bus to Hamburg, where both bus drivers told us we can not ride! However, I have not seen it, again to pay the full price and have continued to wait. When I finally got through to their hotline at 18 o'clock, I was told the bus has long been gone. So I only had the opportunity to take the train to Hamburg. However, I wonder how at least 5 people could have missed the bus (all knew that a white spare bus should come). So I sat 4 hours in the sun, could not buy a toilet or drink anything (the bus could have come in time) and I am very disappointed with the communication and reliability of Flixbus.

{'review': 'We drove on 3.10.14 from Munich to Heidelberg with Flixbus - scheduled departure 10:15. The bus arrived at about 10:10 clock, then the passengers were allowed to invite their luggage. Before boarding, the tickets were checked, causing the departure to be delayed at about 10:30 clock. Unfortunately, more tickets were sold than seats on the bus, so about 20 guests could not ride. So they were allowed to unload their luggage again. There was no information about whether another bus is coming and if so, when. The bus driver had zero customer orientation, no information, no announcements. He answered questions with "I do not know"! At the departure from the central bus station it was not clear from where the bus goes to Heidelberg. It was only for food, but not Heidelberg. On the ticket was also not that it is the bus to Essen.Laut information from other passengers in the bus happens such overbooking at FlixBus often. Where one can then turn, no one says! Although there is a service number on the ticket, but I suspect that on the holiday and on the WE there is none to erreichen.Die ride was quiet and pleasant. In the bus a ventilation was broken, could not turn, so it pulled there (unpleasant). During the drive the toilet paper in the toilet ran out - already in the first Etape (to Stuttgart). When I spoke to the driver (in the break), he just said "problem?", Grinned stupidly and did nothing: service and customer orientation utterly bad! During the journey, there are valid tickets at each stopover station wg. Overbooking stopped (could not ride), there was no information. The drivers themselves (hardly speak German) have not called in the central office to clarify whether another bus is coming. On the return journey (Heidelberg - Munich) on 4.10.14 the bus arrived punctually, it was only half full. However, everywhere in the hallway and on the seats were garbage from previous guests (Essen - Dortmund). At the stopover, the bus crew does not go through the bus and collects the garbage, he stayed until the end lie. Conclusion: if someone wants to go with the clean bus, then I would choose another provider, at FlixBus can happen to you that he buys a ticket, but does not come along and is left without information at the bus station.

If you do not want to pay much more directly at the bus driver, you have to pay for your ticket via the internet and thus you will be completely supervised. Of course, Wi-Fi must be on during the journey, so that the Internet-addicted young people are not on withdrawal. Nobody can think of the fact that you could talk to your neighbor during such a journey. WLAN, like all other pulsed electromagnetic waves, is mutagenic and disturbs brain function. You can sleep worse with it. That's so. But that must be so today. It is a very bad policy decision to allow private long-distance bus services. It would be smarter to lower rail prices. Because on the vast majority of long-distance bus lines already drive anyway, which consume much less energy than buses. Now, if the passengers on long-distance buses dodge, the train is even more expensive, because the running costs are distributed to fewer people. The long-distance buses mean a privatization of public transport. Flixbus benefits from German highways. Once a monopoly position is reached, you can then skim vigorously.", 'stars': '3'}

This means we paid 200 Euros for our train, and only got refunded 44 Euros. So far I haven\'t even seen the lousy 44 Euros, while FlixBus says that I should have received it and I should check my bank account again. Seems like it\'s going to be a long story before I even have those lousy 44 Euros back..The service desk is not available by phone (connection gets cut off, telling you to email them), very rude and unhelpful (if they even answer your questions that is).

{'review': 'In a nutshell: do not trust the delay notification service via SMS. I was told by SMS that the bus was delayed by 70 minutes. A quarter of an hour before departure, I then waited in vain for the bus at the departure. The porky customer service (about 49 cents / minute), which I reached only in the 5th attempt, then told me that the bus was ultimately only 35 minutes late; I missed the bus. The phone call was not refunded. For the refund, it is not enough that you send the documents scanned by mail to the customer service; You will not be refunded postage. Compared to other services, the bus drivers of FlixBus do not have a list of passengers. So you would not have been able to call me. More serious, however, is that this makes overbooking possible (happened to me on the outbound Münster-Siegen). Like those people who can no longer find a seat on the bus, then arrive at their destination is their own problem. When reimbursing, do not assume that you respond individually to your concerns. You only get automated e-mails. Conclusion: No reliability of the driving service and an underground customer service. The first and last time FlixBus for me.', 'stars': '1'}

{'review': "The offer sounded not bad, four tickets for the Flixbus for 10 € per trip. So off to Lidl and strike. The first ride took place on the Friday before Pentecost. It went from Dusseldorf to Bremen. The bus arrived in Dusseldorf 60 minutes late. In Bremen we were 90 minutes late. The way back went smoothly. The next trip took place on the 24th of July. It should go from Cologne to Leipzig. Already at the starting point the bus came 90 minutes late. Shortly before Leipzig the bus broke down. There we were allowed to wait over two hours. After the repair we arrived in Leipzig with more than three hours delay. The way back was on the 27th of July and we were on time on the track. After 90 minutes, we learned from another Flixbus driver that buses today look different than usual. Even in Dresden some guests would not have recognized this bus. The bus for us would have been on time in time, but unfortunately neither my four passengers nor I have recognized this. Since I had to go home, I booked then three hours later a twice as expensive bus at meinfernbus.de. This came on time and the ride went smoothly. After that, at least I wanted to get my money back, because if four other guests did not recognize the bus next to me, it could not have been us. Flixbus sees it differently. It's my own fault, since I did not specify my mobile number. Only this was not compulsory and because they are already rummaging through e-mail, I did not want to give out my number. An email could not write Flixbus and on the homepage under delays, etc. was also nothing. Lists are not kept in the buses, according to Flixbus and the bus driver it was not strange that no one boarded in Leipzig. To call once on the only long-distance bus station, that here the Flixbus comes, would probably have been too much requested ... ..", 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I thought the price for the tickets was okay. But I preferred to do the return trip with another company. The bus (route Hamburg-Berlin) came through the summer traffic too late (30 minutes), which was also understandable due to the many construction sites. But instead of the fact that the company already provides another bus driver, was not given (because of the driving times). Instead, it was then again on the track break of MINIMUM 25 minutes (announced by the bus driver) made, rather another bus driver took over the bus. On the whole, this was a delay of exactly 1 1/2 hours due to the organization of the bus operation operating for Flixbus. In addition, the service in the bus was absolutely bad. One should really sit on a seat that was soaked through a full soda can. According to the bus driver something would not be his problem, as one would have to talk to the person who had sat there before. Well, the person was only out of Hamburg unfortunately !!!!! Flixbus should come up with the idea to include a seat reservation in his program. There was a row over the seats because somebody sat down in the square, where one of them was already sitting, but the one outside had smoked a cigarette in front of the bus. As I said, organizationally you should perhaps improve it. Unfortunately, the bus company does not see me again as a customer, because I then rather pay the 50, - € more (for my inner peace) and then take the train.', 'stars': '1'}

We drove off punctually at 8.30 clock and were with a 15 minute delay in Berlin (which I think is totally fine). Toilet are on board and drinks and small snacks you can buy and not overpriced. So the return trip here, we left on time. Since we had only one driver this time, we have to take a 30 minute break after 4 hours, which was already clear before and was included in the schedule. I have used this with my girlfriend for a doner break. The driver was super nice and has done a snack for everyone. This time we were 10 minutes earlier at the destination than thought wifi was always available which I found very convenient. Unfortunately not enough for the whole trip. The bus was very clean and really new and in good condition. Every time the drivers were super nice and we always felt safe. Before each trip, there was a brief Einweisungsfilm.Der only downside is that you need longer with bus than for example by train or car. But you know that beforehand, if you decide for the bus. By train we would have been there 1.5 hours earlier but also paid 8 times. I was satisfied it all went well', 'stars': '5'}

It would be nice if more attention would be paid that no large backpacks are allowed to be taken on the bus, as the owners are blocking their free space next to them and are unnerved when ma n has to sit down and then it is for everyone cramped when the backpack is trapped at the front. Really annoying is that once again the wifi did not work, that is with my many trips predominantly the case, to advertise is actually unfair. I switched as far as possible to Postbus, even if there is a detour via Malchow, because there is always the wifi works perfectly and there is a luggage check, because it is certain that no suitcase is gone and he is still stowed away by the staff. I'm not so fond of buying snacks while driving, which does not help safety, especially when chatterboxes come forward and then have the money too. The sale should be completed before departure.

{'review': 'I drove on the 30.04.2014 the first time with Flixbus and certainly the last time. Everything went smoothly on the way from Hamburg to Dortmund. The bus driver was friendly and the ride started on time. Well, you can not speak of comfort in the buses, because the rows of seats are already very tight, but you can live. The big surprise, and in a negative sense, I got a few days later, when I returned from Dortmund Hamburg wanted to go. The bus was overbooked, so there was no more space for me and two other passengers. So what to do? It was not possible to stand, so a solution had to be found. After consulting the very nice driver, he contacted Flixbus to find a solution. This looked then so that we should buy tickets for the next EC of the Deutsche Bahn, and then come by train to its destination. Although everything went so far unproblematic from, but it can not be that there are no seats for customers with valid tickets and they themselves have to see how they get to their destination. On 04.06.2014, I then received an e-mail from Flixbus , in which I was informed that from the overbooking of the bus and the resulting purchase of a train ticket costs incurred in the amount of € 68.00 for reasons of goodwill € 44.00 be reimbursed. Mind you: The ticket was only after specific agreement with the bus driver, who has personally contacted with Flixbus, bought. Today Flixbus claims that the refund of a ticket for an IC / EC is not provided. For me and the other two passengers not taken along, the only option was to drive in an EC. If Flixbus does not agree to fully reimburse the costs incurred, I will call a lawyer without further warning. What this company does is the very last and I can only warn everyone to travel with Flixbus. It remains to be hoped that this company disappears as soon as possible from the market in the course of the competition. At present, I continue to argue with this "company" and will proceed with all means at my disposal, against Flixbus! In front of this provider, I can really just warn everyone urgently!', 'stars': '1'}
{'review': 'I booked my return trip from Berlin to Nuremberg this weekend. Scheduled departure was at 13:00. We were punctual at half past 2 at the ZOB like many other passengers as well, but unfortunately the bus was far and wide no trace. We were informed for half an hour about nothing until after three quarters of an hour but the explanation came that the bus is in a traffic jam. So far everything is fine. But when he was finally there the bus driver said he still had to take a three quarters of an hour break because he came from Rostock. That too is understandable but what happened after that is a bottomless impudence! In the bus there was a total of 51 people. The problem was that this bus had more than 51 people booked so we could not accommodate all. The solution of the bus driver was finally to let so many people on the bus, as places were available and the rest could think on good German even as they should come home! Although the company takes over the cost of trains, but not ICEs, which would have been the only way we had returned to Nuremberg. Fortunately we had managed to get a seat but there was a family and more people in Berlin with no idea how they should come home! Scheduled arrival was in Nuremberg at 18:55 we were finally at 22:15 in Nuremberg and on a Sunday! The whole with the overbooking seems to have already been on the way to Berlin, as otherwere told by passengers.

{'review': 'First the positive: punctual departure, punctual arrival, nice drivers, clean Busse.Jetzt the negative, the pricing when traveling to Austria: If you drive from Munich to Austria, you have to change in Salzburg in the Westbahn (cooperation with Flixbus). Be sure to book two separate tickets, then save up to 10.50 euros. Example: Munich-Salzburg booked with Flixbus on the Internet 9,00 Euro. Salzburg-Attnang / Puchheim with the Westbahn 7.50 Euro, makes together 16.50 Euro, a favorable price. But if you book the ticket at Flixbus, you have to pay at least 27,00 Euro, which means 10,50 Euro more and still transfer to the Westbahn in Salzburg. The Westbahn is not responsible for this pricing, it will charge you in any case each time only € 7.50. Response to written request came only after 2 weeks, but no justification for these charges. Written advertising message from Flixbus in the email that this trip is offered for 15 euros: but there is no way on the website and no date on which the trip can be booked.
