A passenger even forbidden go toilet checking last person, although departure time 15 minutes later. The statement driver "then stay Munich, suit you" .2.

But arranged passenger everyone knows return bus. According plan, could 45 minute break. In case, proceeding without consideration examination.

The following points suggest view loss luggage ultimately caused Flixbus personnel: 1. In telephone call Flixbus customer service I told normally baggage sorted driver sorted departure depending destination, misunderstandings clearing out. This case Berlin. There driver give luggage, done every passenger.2. The driver section Munich Konstanz informed luggage space empty took bus Munich obviously (for reason I see) emptied Flixbus staff, backpack cleared back been. The driver also informed longer stays recommended take luggage bus give back. This also communicated before. Now over. A mistake always happen, especially since drivers noticeably high pressure.

The German operator (if choose English, doomed: get connected operator repeating words 'refund voucher' without even trying understand situation...) finally understood nature trouble, called back 50 mins news they've arranged connecting bus 22:00 Brussels Amsterdam we'll catch. So did, finally got Amsterdam midnight, meant instead public transport take taxi accomodation. We distressed bag nerves then.You would believe it's impossible trump bad travel experience, return trip 4/7/2016 Amsterdam London (changeover Antwerp, scheduled arrival: 17:45) added new factor: fear death. Another non-communicating German driver decided take ferry (!) across channel time, decision made I accidentally overheard phone. He forgot communicate passengers, despite fact straightaway meant 3-hour delay minimum compared Eurotunnel route.We hours late arriving London night, top bus hit height restricting barrier driving tunnel! And driver didn't seem care, drove tunnel nothing happened!! We literally fearing lives driver drove two tracks, trying avoid crashing top bus wall tunnel either side. The driver lost plot completely: first drove straight City London, making tricky U-turn coming corner bus could manage. Then got lost right next Victoria Coach Station, drove us Brompton Road make another road-blocking U-turn Victoria & Albert Museum. From point fellow passenger helping bus driver phone Google Maps find destination... Finally arrived Victoria Coach Station, could laugh drive go international arrivals instead block away. Almost 5 hours late, another nerve-wrecking travel experience topped fear death, finally disembarked 22:15.Despite several complaints mail phone, day still haven't received formal apology refund Flixbus cancelled trip. The elusive customer service line total shambles, three attempts asking refund I received following replies phone, chronological order:1. transferred 5 working days (didn't happen)2. I didn't claim refund all, haven't registered anything3. lastly, transferred 4-6 weeks(!!!)", 'stars': '1'}
 {'review': "On 29th June I booked 5:45am bus Flixbus Dresden Central Berlin SXF airport, arrive airport 7:50am.I waiting bus stop 5:20am. This 5:45am bus never arrived. After 6 one guy telelephoned Flixbus us waiting bus getting anxious flights catch, told would another 10 minutes. At 6:30am 6:15am bus arrived 15 minutes late took us we're waiting. Once bus internet service all.Unfortunately us waiting 5:45am bus didn't arrive Berlin SXF 9:10am.For others boarding gate closed. I missed flight connecting flight Paris chance getting home afternoon. So overnight train journey full next day train 350euro pocket I finally arrived home next day 5pm.When I arrived home I sent complaint fact bus never turned I notified wasn't coming plus fact I paid 19 euro 5:45am bus 6:15 bus 12 euro I booked it. The reply back I allowed time flight send booking number could inform I hadn't notified delay. I reply since sent another complaint response. If bus arrived time delayed route Berlin due traffic problems accident , I could understand. But bus turn notification anyone would delay ...to totally unacceptable disgusting. IT WAS A BUS GOING TO AN AIRPORT course people flights catch.Reply FlixbusThanks reply Flixbus. I give phone number appears didn't go through. I 3 trips booked company week I gave number booking, ph number came two bookings doesn't appear one. Seeing buses travel long distances offer bus services airports. Maybe could bought customers attention making booking buses run 11/2 2hrs late due distance travel possibility traffic delays driver rest breaks. As I booked bus web site gave 3 departure time options 3.20am 5:45am 6:15am morning three buses arriving Berlin SXF Dresden morning arrival time 9am actual fact due traffic delays etc claiming? Supposedly early bus 3.20am would made 9am. Had I made aware fact prior booking I could booked earlier bus. There distressed people waiting bus 29th people miss flight. When booking made doesn't mention bus coming could long delays. In fairness customers clearly stated.", 'stars': '1'}
 {'review': "I booked return Eindhoven Bruges Flixbus, thinking would convenient less stressful driving. However, mistake. A things aware you're considering booking Flixbus:1) The bus run extremely late, won't inform accurately. From Eindhoven Bruges, bus arrived 30 minutes late, way back, bus arrived hour late. In end, along 45 minute 'break' remote gas station despite fact running extremely late already, I arrived Eindhoven 2 hours later time given Flixbus.2) Nothing works. The toilet wasn't working, wifi advertise trips false claim apparently doesn't work outside Germany. 3) Extremely unfriendly staff. The bus driver snapped passengers asked 45 minute stop remote gas station bus already running 1.5 hours late. My guess it's legal requirement, it's guess given explanation it. If driver would taken time explain reason stop, would better mood.In conclusion, whilst Flixbus great concept appears offer convenient alternative driving trains, I would advise users think twice booking may long frustrating journey.", 'stars': '1'}
