The trip pleasant without complications. The return trip turns complete opposite. The reason following: According plan, arrive 21:30 Ravensburg Escher-Wyss-Straße 9. We never reached stop. The bus driver left us 20:45 Bahnhofsplatz 5. His reason: At agreed stop many people walk underpass get back actual station. Unfortunately, several people (mostly women) sat bus walk exactly underpass due new location defined bus driver, car, bike, etc. parked right there. There say. On suggestion would arrive much earlier planned, quite possible continue approach planned final stop time answered sentence. "You\'re welcome get like it!".

The passengers even asked case allowed walk luggage underpass scheduled arrival. Based time mail, certainly see let much earlier planned wrong destination. In itself, earlier arrival time problem. But not, considering way done: 1. The departure station Munich left 18:14 last registered passenger checked in. A passenger even forbidden go toilet checking last person, although departure time 15 minutes later. The statement driver "then stay Munich, suit you" .2. Despite 30 minutes earlier arrival time Leutkirch jumped driver leaving last passenger destination Leutkirch directly bus drove without asking. Had intervened time, would passenger wanted Ravensburg, "sit" remained wanted stretch legs. Again, bus driver fell sentence "we make fun event" ein.Ich personally problem short breaks. But arranged passenger everyone knows return bus. According plan, could 45 minute break. In case, proceeding without consideration examination. In company far I able hear primitive expression driver trip. This may also due non-existent separation driver passenger, case example railway. However, excuse way passengers communicate. 4.

But came return journey Konstanz angry awakening. When I arrived Konstanz luggage disappeared storage room. Value well 500 EUR. The following points suggest view loss luggage ultimately caused Flixbus personnel: 1. In telephone call Flixbus customer service I told normally baggage sorted driver sorted departure depending destination, misunderstandings clearing out. This case Berlin. There driver give luggage, done every passenger.2. The driver section Munich Konstanz informed luggage space empty took bus Munich obviously (for reason I see) emptied Flixbus staff, backpack cleared back been. The driver also informed longer stays recommended take luggage bus give back. This also communicated before. Now over. A mistake always happen, especially since drivers noticeably high pressure. The real sad thing story subsequent contact customer service. First, I wait almost two weeks I informed lost property office luggage appeared Munich. Why lasts two weeks beyond me. No comments, nothing. Upon inquiries, I finally asked inform another request via contact form website damages. There I described exact situation, attached list lost luggage items value simply also several queries NOTHING Flixbus heard. That's 6 weeks ago. Even telephone inquiries simply abgewimmelt excuse contact person could connected, I could submit requests via contact form. That brings lot disappear Nirvana. The really sad thing story Flixbus company would lot potential eyes, sooner later fail. It understand today's world, company long-term existence treats ignores customers. Low prices ok, want them, better 10% make sure minimum amount customer service maintained. So Flixbus sooner later able hold customers absolutely dependent low prices.

 {'review': "On 29th June I booked 5:45am bus Flixbus Dresden Central Berlin SXF airport, arrive airport 7:50am.I waiting bus stop 5:20am. This 5:45am bus never arrived. After 6 one guy telelephoned Flixbus us waiting bus getting anxious flights catch, told would another 10 minutes. At 6:30am 6:15am bus arrived 15 minutes late took us we're waiting. Once bus internet service all.Unfortunately us waiting 5:45am bus didn't arrive Berlin SXF 9:10am.For others boarding gate closed. I missed flight connecting flight Paris chance getting home afternoon. So overnight train journey full next day train 350euro pocket I finally arrived home next day 5pm.When I arrived home I sent complaint fact bus never turned I notified wasn't coming plus fact I paid 19 euro 5:45am bus 6:15 bus 12 euro I booked it. The reply back I allowed time flight send booking number could inform I hadn't notified delay. I reply since sent another complaint response. If bus arrived time delayed route Berlin due traffic problems accident , I could understand. But bus turn notification anyone would delay ...to totally unacceptable disgusting. IT WAS A BUS GOING TO AN AIRPORT course people flights catch.Reply FlixbusThanks reply Flixbus. I give phone number appears didn't go through. I 3 trips booked company week I gave number booking, ph number came two bookings doesn't appear one. Seeing buses travel long distances offer bus services airports. Maybe could bought customers attention making booking buses run 11/2 2hrs late due distance travel possibility traffic delays driver rest breaks. As I booked bus web site gave 3 departure time options 3.20am 5:45am 6:15am morning three buses arriving Berlin SXF Dresden morning arrival time 9am actual fact due traffic delays etc claiming? Supposedly early bus 3.20am would made 9am. Had I made aware fact prior booking I could booked earlier bus. There distressed people waiting bus 29th people miss flight. When booking made doesn't mention bus coming could long delays. In fairness customers clearly stated.", 'stars': '1'}
 {'review': "I booked return Eindhoven Bruges Flixbus, thinking would convenient less stressful driving. However, mistake. A things aware you're considering booking Flixbus:1) The bus run extremely late, won't inform accurately. From Eindhoven Bruges, bus arrived 30 minutes late, way back, bus arrived hour late. In end, along 45 minute 'break' remote gas station despite fact running extremely late already, I arrived Eindhoven 2 hours later time given Flixbus.2) Nothing works. The toilet wasn't working, wifi advertise trips false claim apparently doesn't work outside Germany. 3) Extremely unfriendly staff. The bus driver snapped passengers asked 45 minute stop remote gas station bus already running 1.5 hours late. My guess it's legal requirement, it's guess given explanation it. If driver would taken time explain reason stop, would better mood.In conclusion, whilst Flixbus great concept appears offer convenient alternative driving trains, I would advise users think twice booking may long frustrating journey.", 'stars': '1'}

 {'review': "With five hours kill Munich's bus station, write review. The gist is, Flixbus worked seamlessly, without traffic jams, it's great. But case, didn't.

The English speaking hotline available certain hours. If dial 1 English hours, hang automatically. 4. Traffic jams happen twice. Even 45 minute lay enough catch connecting bus.
