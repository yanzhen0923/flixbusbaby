 {'review': 'I booked trip Brussels Mainz. There direct bus, I change Leverkusen Mitte. I spontaneously decided trip, I booked 3 days departure. Usually, I use train, situation I wanted try bus discover one city way Mainz. Of course, I realized Leverkusen best choice. The trip well priced, I paid around 40 EUR, relatively around 10 per bus I used. Starting Brussels Leverkusen Mitte(the first bus), everything fine. I try wi-fi first bus. However, I like second part trip Leverkusen Mitte Mainz, delay. This something blame company for. They send two messages bus late 50 minutes 75 minutes. The bus arrived 105 minutes delay. The wi-fi one extremely slow, even though people sleeping. I 2 seats away toilet, smelling unfortunately. The driver worst experience trip. I aware many breaks usually driver do, one 20 minutes 5 minutes 200km. He even got confused Wiesbaden went wrong direction caused even bigger delay. On way back everything good. The drivers nice, especially Leverkusen Brussels. The wi-fi working good. There even coffee machine bus, I think coffee free, I sure. Overall I would grade company 7 10.
