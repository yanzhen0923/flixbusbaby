Plus, maybe I would like come visit town travelled.3. Improve Delay notification - For part, Flixbus pretty punctual, delays happen...I want know realistic estimate time arrival. Update times necessary.4. Movies - (are AWESOME!) - would great one could easily determine dubbed original language.5. Bus stop arrival/departure signage/instructions - part, easy determine bus destination departing (especially Berlin), Dresden real challenge.
