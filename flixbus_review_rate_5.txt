Was very pleased with you, easy booking, as well as friendly drivers and modern, as new buses with comfortable seating, Wi-Fi and power outlet for smartphones. And best of all, neither by train nor by car is this possible at such a price. The big advantage of traveling by car is that you can sit back comfortably after a great day of sightseeing and not have to drive home for a few hours at night. You can just get in and out of the bus without having to worry about parking your car. I had a wonderful day in Budapest with great weather. The bus at 21:00 clock from Budapest was just right, the time is always too short in Budapest and so I could take some great photos of the chain bridge and castle at night before I drove to the station Budapest Népliget. From the bus station I was also positively surprised, at night brightly lit and a safe, clean and clear waiting area. Was even more pleasant than the bus station Vienna Erdberg. I rode with you for the first time and really loved it. Would be great if there are often such offers - here in Austria Flixbus is unfortunately not as widespread as in Germany.

A little escape to the south. - The Flixbus rides (round trip) were pleasant, punctual, reliable. - In this case, the offer (timetable, price, location of stops) simply "fit". In some other cities, the stops are unfortunately "in the Pampa" (Ulm, Augsburg, Bressanone). [SUPPLEMENT:] Trustpilot states: "[Flixbus] does not invite". That does not correspond (more) to the facts. After completing the Flixbus internal survey today, I was asked to rate it here as well. Since I had awarded ***** in the internal survey, Flixbus could expect that I would give a favorable opinion also with Trustpilot. Trustpilot should update the entry (currently "Do not load") accordingly.', 'stars': '5'}

{'review': 'I was unable to catch a Flixbus ride due to a major medical appointment that lasted longer than usual. For this reason, I decided to rebook the trip. The bus left at 15.25, and I wanted to start the transfer at 15.13 clock. Unfortunately, this could not be done, because I requested 3 minutes to change the booking too late. Oh well - I immediately called the customer service. However, he made the impression of sitting abroad and reading ready-made texts. I was with the sentence "I\'m sorry, if the bus has already left, it can not be rebooked" in the broken German fed. I could not believe that, since Flixbus still called customer-oriented, at least the management. So I wrote Flixbus on Facebook. Here I was told that I can somehow cancel it, minus cancellation fees. For this I have to contact a contact form. Again, you got miserable long texts that only partially respond to my question. Upon request, if you can answer my question now individually, you just meant to make me aware of the contact form so that I can assert my rebooking. OK! at least something. I described the problem again in the contact form. I thought, now it could work. I have described everything exactly, as well as here. And what came in response? I was presented with the available methods of payment & was told that I can download invoices for the tax office. Yes! My request to customer support was what to do if the bus has already left, but was unable to fulfill the time frame of the transfer. And the answer was an idea of \u200b\u200bthe means of payment available. That\'s called Customer Service on Flixbus! Thank you:) Addendum: on a reply to the e-mail that FlixBus should respond to inquiry, they have then sent me a coupon codes :)', 'stars': '5'}

{'review': 'What lies in the hands of Flixbus, was completely fine for us. What annoys me and my wife is the completely inadequate infrastructure of almost all stops and ZOBs.

{'review': 'The route Wiesbaden-Munich I am always driven by train, this time but looking for different reasons an alternative. For 19,35 € (with CO2 tax) I did not expect much pleasant, the comparable train ticket would have 59,00 - 101 , 00 € cost. Booking and payment by Internet and ticket on the phone went without any problems. Some hours before departure I got a text message that the bus was not green, but white. What an inconvenience! ;) The bus came exactly on time, the driver helped me with the loading of the suitcase and after he had assured the full toughness of his guests, we drove off in a clean, comfortable and quiet atmosphere. The half-hour break in Würzburg was not unpleasant, the ride on country roads through beautiful landscapes (instead of highway congestion) I really enjoyed. We have reached the city punctually on time, but in the Rushrour against 17:00 but a few minutes longer needed to the ZOB, as planned. The only disadvantage compared to the train I see in the comparison of travel time. With the fixed bus I needed a total of 7 hours, for the comparable distance I need 4 hours by train (assuming I get my connections and there is no track noise). I had a guaranteed seat in the bus, in the train I would have this to book. However, this would be omitted again if a replacement train should have been used, as it happens very often. On the way it was very quiet, because everyone was busy with his smartphone or laptop, which was well possible thanks to Wi-Fi and 220V power outlet in each window seat. The rest has read or slept. The driver had quietly his radio on, that was ok. My conclusion: If I have the choice, I drive only with the bus. While there is no time, but nerves and money.', 'stars': '5'}

{'review': 'I travel regularly with MeinFernbus / Flixbus on the route Leipzig-Potsdam and Leipzig-Berlin. The bus always leaves punctually in Leipzig - but sometimes it is not at least 15 minutes before departure, just as you would expect from the passengers. Since there are still plenty of places available, I will never be forced by the bus driver to put my big backpack (which according to the terms and conditions is no longer under "hand luggage") in the luggage rack, so that I can always have my valuables with me. Wi-Fi works great in 90% of all trips, sockets are always available, space selection is sufficient, if you are there on time. So far, the drivers never seemed unfocused on the highway and all spoke German. Most of the time the bus arrives at the destination for even 5-10 minutes, which benefits many, who have to catch a connection train / bus, etc. On the monitors is shown a map with current location, here I would still want a navigation software (with estimated time of arrival) to inform yourself in advance with the bus WLan about the times of possible connections to continue. The buses were always clean, the seats comfortable, sometimes the air conditioning is a bit too cold for my taste, but that sure everyone sees differently;) Overall, I am very satisfied with MeinFernbus / Flixbus.', 'stars': '5'}

{'review': "The booking works simply via the Flixbus website or the also very well functioning app. You can pay, among other things, conveniently by Paypal or debit. The buses are really class, comfortable seats, plenty of legroom (I'm between 1.85 and 1.90 and there are still almost 10 cm between my knees and the seat in front of me), There are sockets that you can use and Wi-Fi (which is not always perfect). It is simply incredible how much more convenient the bus is than the German train (except ICE) and it costs the route I most often with Flixbus drive less than a third of what I would pay for the train. The delays are also limited. Of course it may be that the bus is already 5 hours on the way is 15 minutes late, but that is rare and is more likely to be the exception than the rule, in all I am very satisfied. CLEARLY cheaper and more convenient than the train and also the best long-distance bus provider with whom I drove so far. As flexible as the train is of course not, but the route network is not tight enough and the buses go too rarely, but if you are flexible in time You can travel very long distances here.", 'stars': '5'}

So the return trip here, we left on time. Since we had only one driver this time, we have to take a 30 minute break after 4 hours, which was already clear before and was included in the schedule. I have used this with my girlfriend for a doner break. The driver was super nice and has done a snack for everyone. This time we were 10 minutes earlier at the destination than thought wifi was always available which I found very convenient. Unfortunately not enough for the whole trip. The bus was very clean and really new and in good condition. Every time the drivers were super nice and we always felt safe. Before each trip, there was a brief Einweisungsfilm.Der only downside is that you need longer with bus than for example by train or car. But you know that beforehand, if you decide for the bus.

{'review': "I travel with the route 601 Göteborg-Uppsala (and back) frequently since the end of August and have never had any problems with Flixbus. For that price I had expected worse, especially considering the reviews I found here. When you look through all these, keep in mind: it's always the gnomes who scream at the top of the web. This is what you need to know: Do you have a limited budget and one day to take you from location A to location B, ride Flixbus. I pay $ 50 to take me from Borås to Norrköping, a trip that could have cost 300 kronor or more, and for someone with student budget it's really nice to have the option. There are about 3-4 buses a day: one in the morning, one in the middle of the day, one in the evening and possibly one at night. The bus will take +/- 5 minutes departure time depending on the day and traffic. Once the bus was delayed to a station, about 20 minutes, and it was due to road work so it was no wonder that the driver reduced the delay to 10 minutes at the next stop. The first time I went with them, a mother complained that the toilet was not working and the driver stayed in the first place he could and fixed the mistake in less than 5 minutes. Can not say they feel cheerful and happy every time but I have probably never experienced bus drivers. I will not lie about the seats, it is very crowded. If you go later than the starting station, you can count on everyone, I repeat ALL, who themselves take up two seats for themselves and do not really understand this by going to municipal. You simply have to star around until someone is ashamed enough to clean the seat next to them. It's never smockful but the bus is filled up well during the journey so take into account all who come in. There are many couples who have to sit separately because some people are too stubborn to move. For the price, it's a sick host trip that goes very fast. If it is advisable that you arrive at a special time and have an important meeting, you may choose something else but for those who would like to save on travel expenses, go for it.", 'stars': '5'}

Bus in place 5-10 min before departure time 12:45. Welcome in Swedish by ticket controller. Went on a clean and fresh bus with working wifi as iofs did not allow large amounts of traffic. The driver drove without a remark and we arrived in Lund at 15:45. Perfect trip for my part, but it actually feels like an unreasonably low price, which I consider to be a way for the company to enter the market.

The only thing that I think need to add is that it would be nice if we could contact the driver in case of emergency. Yesterday I was in a ship to ancona but it was 2 hours late and thats why I lost my bus from Ancona to Verona for 10 minutes. If I could call the driver somehow the moment I step out of the ship maybe he could wait 10 minutes for me and the 4 more persons in the same situation that I was travelling with.

{'review': 'I have travelled using Flixbus several times since moving to Berlin in February 2015.  I find it to be a good alternative to the train.  The buses are always comfortable with a clean restroom, comfy seats, and fully stocked snack selection.  My last bus from Flensburg also had a hot drink machine.  I also appreciate the power outlets and FREE Wi-fi plus a selection of movies, which stream very smoothly.  Here are my recommendations to further improve Flixbus:1. Clarify how many stops there will be between the point of origin and destination.  When I traveled to Flensburg, there were approximately 4 stops but the ticket said "Direct".  2. Instruct Driver\'s to announce all the stop names.  Often times, I am going to town that I have not yet visited and I do not know when I have arrived.  Plus, maybe I would like to come visit a town through which we have travelled.3. Improve Delay notification - For the most part, Flixbus has been pretty punctual, but delays happen...I just want to know a realistic estimate of the time of arrival.  Update times if necessary.4.  Movies - (are AWESOME!) - it would be great if one could easily determine which were dubbed and which are in original language.5. Bus stop arrival/departure signage/instructions - for the most part, it has been easy to determine from where the bus to my destination will be departing (especially in Berlin), but Dresden was a real challenge.  It\'s a wide spanning area and when I last travelled there were signs differentiating destinations (maybe this has been updated?).Overall, these are small details. Flixbus is the best deal on last minute travel within Germany based on price, service, and reliability.  I will continue to highly recommend your company.', 'stars': '5'}
{'review': "I've been using FlixBus to travel between Hamburg and Berlin. The buses are mostly on time, if they're late information is communicated within a timely fashion. The buses are clean, well-equipped and comfortable. The drivers are without exception extremely polite and well-rested. Absolutely recommended service.", 'stars': '5'}
{'review': "Have used flixbus extensively while travelling around Europe over the last few months and the value for mkney against other forms of transport can't be beaten. With the bonus of wifi and ac plugs plus more comfortable chairs than most other bus companies, it's the best way to travel on a budget.", 'stars': '5'}
