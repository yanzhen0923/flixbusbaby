I understand well traveling land, traffic etc, would desirable driver WARNED delay, late increases, say microphone. The last 5 trips I 45 minutes 3 passes late, without anyone warning us anything. 2) Stops. It seems stops depend driver number hours drives. It unthinkable face 11-hour journey, delay become 14 stop unless bring people down. Good late, it's good drivers need give gear half But also passengers, many make long distances (as case famous 11/14 hours, I alone). 3) The methods communication. Maybe it's limit, I know European languages. When driver says something microphone, could make small summary English. Repeat maybe limit, Germany communications German German, Italy Italian, France French I think poor passengers speak language place left flixbus.4) The organization. Maybe it's bit general affirmation, organization leaves desired. Starting from: landing destination climb retrieve luggage hold (do ask drivers are, I know); get destination know driver declare delay know destination stop after; trip I'm NOT LOOKING, one seemed passengers !! Or anyway passengers be. PANIC good 20 minutes, stand middle nowhere figure happened. Conclusion tight sardines continued journey stop someone went down.
